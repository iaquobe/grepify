#Introduction

It's grep for lyrics in a Spotify playlist.\
Because there is no better way to search things than with a regex.

#Usage

Right now `spotigrep` is just a proof of concept, here are the limitations that come with it:\
* there is no installation
* the genius api is downloading at painfully slow speed (I'll look into that soon)
* you need to run it from the git root (the file references need it that way)

##Getting started

first you need api keys for `Spotify` and `Genius`\
You can get both for free at:\
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
under Dashboard

and:
https://docs.genius.com/
under Manage Clients
