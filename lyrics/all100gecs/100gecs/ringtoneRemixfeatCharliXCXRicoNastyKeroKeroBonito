100 gecs, ringtone (Remix) [feat. Charli XCX, Rico Nasty, Kero Kero Bonito]:i
[Intro: Charli XCX]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
When he calls me, I go crazy
Call me with my friends, it doesn't phase me
Windows down, ridin' in the SUV
And I'm spillin' champagne all on my screen, screamin'
Wheels are screechin', hundred miles per hour
He like me 'cause I'm wild, camera phone in the shower
Ring-ring, gonna let it ring out
Sounds so good, wanna turn it up loud

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 2: Sarah Bonito]
KKB, AAC
Your ringtone could be anything
A barking dog, revved engine
Whatever catches your attention
It's your choice
Would you like to hear my voice?
Or is it hard to talk
When you're scared of where the call is coming from?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
I think I might be addicted to your kisses
Lovestruck, baby, you're the piece I'm missin'
I know you're what I'm lookin' for and I'm so tired of wishin'
We can do it now or later, it don't make a difference
He sent me a text, says "See you when you get here"
I was lonely last week, but I won't be next year
Kiss me on my left cheek, love me like my bestie
On the phone with Ashley, run shit like an athlete
We be at the game, yeah, but we never play them
He could be in danger, I still wouldn't save him
I be in the front like Rudolph the Reindeer
I can tell you got a crush, that's the reason why you came here
You ain't gotta lie, just be honest with yourself
You wouldn't be here if it was for anyone else
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
And when he calls me, I don't come home

[Bridge: Sarah Bonito]
Throw away my phone, hide it somewhere no one knows
Buried it in the ground, so it can never be found
But I still hear it, I hear the sound of your ringtone
It's a crime, why can't I get you outta my mind?

[Interlude: Laura Les]
My boy's got—
Wait, Charli, can you sing the chorus again please?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I— (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Outro: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I—
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer
