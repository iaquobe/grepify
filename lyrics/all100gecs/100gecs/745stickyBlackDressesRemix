[Chorus: Laura Les & Devi McCallion]
I make my money on my own, yeah (Yeah)
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah (Yeah)
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah (Yeah)
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah (Yeah)
I've been on a roll, yeah (Yeah)
I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah (Yeah)
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
(Goddamn, what the fuck, what the fuck?)

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
I'm done trying to plan
Do what I want, don't hold my hand
I can do anything I want, first try
You take like ten tries, hurtin' my eyes

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady with Devi McCallion]
Batshit, got a check and I spent it
Money got me feelin' like a dentist
I can do anything I put my mind to
You can't do anything even if you wanted to

[Chorus: Laura Les, Devi McCallion]
I make my money on my own, yeah (Yeah)
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah (Yeah)
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah (Yeah)
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
I've been on a roll, yeah (Yeah)
I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady with Devi McCallion]
Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Goddamn, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?
Goddamn, what the—

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
Make my money on my own, yeah
Spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Devi McCallion]
Goddamn, what the fuck?
What the fuck, what the fuck?
Goddamn, what the fuck?
What the fuck?
Goddamn, what the fuck
What the fuck, what the—
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

Watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out, watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
Watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out (I can do, I can, I can, I can)
Watch out
