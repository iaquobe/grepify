[Intro: Dylan Brady]
I look outside and see your bright eyes
I don't know if I can get to you
Don't know if I'll be back (if I'll be back)
I don't know how to be alone
I'm always looking at the phone
(Ooh) Waiting for your call
(Okay, alright, okay, alright, I see)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can see it right now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I needed this more than you will ever know
I needed this more than you will ever know

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Dishes are piling up
But that's cool
'Cause at least we got food
Yeah, everything is pilin' up
But that's cool, that's cool
'Cause at least I got you, I got you, I got you
Tell me that you don't want to bug me
I'll tell you, "Baby, bein' here is nothing"
Call me anytime you're feelin' lonely
(Okay, alright, okay, alright, I see)
And I'm running home to be with you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I can see it right now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Dishes all accounted for
Got about a counter full
Yeah, I'm always out of bounds
Yeah, I'm not responsible
But I'm always counted for
Fuckin' up but riding home
Corner store to studio
To work and then I'm back to you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
Now
You're sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
Sitting all alone, and you call me on the phone
And you say, "I need love, can you get to me now?"
