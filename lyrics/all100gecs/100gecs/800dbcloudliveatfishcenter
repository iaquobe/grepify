[Intro: Laura Les, Dylan Brady & Both]
He said, "I love you," on the plane, I said, "I love you too"
He said, "Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new"
I said, "Nothing's new, nothing's changed, I still need you" (Let's go)
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Ahh
Smokin' somethin' new
One, two, three, go

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady, Laura Les & Both]
Roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, gotta saw it off
I got a bag on the way (Uh, uh)
Smokin' a zip in a day (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
What were you trying to say? (Uh, oh, oh, oh)
Making it up on the way

[Bridge: Laura Les, Dylan Brady]
I never say what I need when I need you (Need you)
I never say what I need when I need you
I'm okay on the weed, but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof (Go)

[Verse 2: Laura Les & Both]
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin' clouds so loud, you can't fuckin' see, yeah
I'm addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I'm addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Outro: Laura Les]
Oh
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
I hit the big boof and the weed, yeah
I hit the big boof, then it's gone
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
Oh, shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Ah
