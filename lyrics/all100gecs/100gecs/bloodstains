100 gecs, bloodstains:i
[Verse 1: Laura Les]
I'm just staring at my empty cans that sprawl across my floor
I'm smoking dope in empty cans I got from corner stores
There's broken glass from broken pieces lying in my sink
I'll wash them down with water getting harder ending blinks
I'll hang with this old feeling, treat it like another friend
We'll sit and watch some YouTube videos, we're staying in
We'll feed a doggo playing looking good with new veneer
Then end the night in covers, whisper nothings in my ear

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Don't say it's personal
'Cause I'm fine, I can do anything
I don't need you
I don't need you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I've got bloodstains in my bathtub, I've got vomit on my floor
I've got Popov in my vomit, smell it as I leave my door
I've got three cans of Four Loko just to go and see your face
Going through it every weekend just to Steven leave my place

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
It's really just a doggo feeling shy about their teeth
I'm walking feeling fall, I might just catch a falling leaf
I'll catch it in my mouth and I'll refuse to tear it up
I'll take it home and put it on my table in a cup
I notice it looks good, sitting next to all my empty shit
I'll clean just a little, just to show it to my friend
I'll notice that they're leaving, but they leave their bags unpacked
They say it's nothing major and they promise to be back

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Don't say it's personal
'Cause I'm fine, I can do anything
I don't need you
I don't need you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
I've got bloodstains in my bathtub, I've got vomit on my floor
I've got Popov in my vomit, smell it as I leave my door
I've got three cans of Four Loko just to go and see your face
Going through it every weekend just to Steven leave my place
