Wett Brain, IDLY:i
[Chorus: Wett Brain]
All I ever wanted was a girl like you with some face tattoos to love me as I fade away
All I ever needed was a Goyard bag and Louis V hat [?] might take the pain away
But I don't love you, I only call you up when I can't find a way there
Cause I don't love you, I only bring you around when I'm coming down here
When I come down and you're not around, it gets harder to breathe on my own
I need [?] in a field far away just for my head to feel like a home
Or I'll lose my composure [?]
And start putting things right up my nose
[?] pretty empty when you just can't quite seem to let go
All I еver wanted was a girl like you with somе face tattoos to love me as I fade away
All I ever needed was a Goyard bag and Louis V hat [?] might take the pain away
But I don't love you, I only call you up when I can't find a way there
Cause I don't love you, I only bring you around when I'm coming down here

[Verse: Capoxxo]
We can hit the mall, buy you anything you want b
Fuck your ice tea, I put lean all on my Hi-C
[?] ice cream [?] yea let's do it nicely
And I can't sleep [?] for you to text me
And at my house wear designer or get kicked out, you're a bad hoe
[?]
Got my 4, I'ma shoot if you act out
I don't got clout, but your bitch said that I am next up
Stuck in my head, I just can't sleep
And sometimes I wish that drugs killed me
And baby I can't stop calling your number
Just tell me if we're not meant for each other

[Chorus: Wett Brain]
All I ever wanted was a girl like you with some face tattoos to love me as I fade away
All I ever needed was a Goyard bag and Louis V hat [?] might take the pain away
But I don't love you, I only call you up when I can't find a way there
Cause I don't love you, I only bring you around when I'm coming down here
