Wett Brain, Roaches:i
[Chorus: Wett Brain]
Chic, white, dope
Got me lit up like a matchstick
I gotta have it, burn holes in my mattress
Roaches, roaches in my casket
Roaches, roaches in my casket

[Verse 1: Wett Brain]
Do you love me?
Would you come to my funeral?
When I'm gone, will you still be there?
Am I gonna have to find out the hard way?
I wanna know before it's too late
So don't put me in a box hill
My casket drops and I'll laugh still
You'll find out the hard way
About the pain of loss and heartache

[Chorus: Wett Brain]
Chic, white, dope
Got me lit up like a matchstick
I gotta have it, burn holes in my mattress
Roaches, roaches in my caskеt
Roaches, roaches in my casket

[Verse 2: Aryia]
Tragic habits likе I'm an addict
Haven't been the same since about this time last year
All these highs are bringing me down
All my friends are watching me drown
Tragic habits like I'm an addict
Fucking on me, Gucci all black
You know she love that sad shit
Gothic, rachet, lay her on the mattress
Make her do a backflip
You know I'm a sad shit

[Bridge: Wett Brain & Aryia]
I got holes in my teeth where my heart used to be
I got scars on my wrist, wear my heart on my sleeve
Sinking feeling, falling faster
Ripped jeans, sad boy, that's–last year

[Chorus: Wett Brain]
Chic, white, dope
Got me lit up like a matchstick
I gotta have it, burn holes in my mattress
Roaches, roaches in my casket
Roaches, roaches in my casket
