Killstation, Broken:i
[Intro]
Broken
You were the only thing holding my life
I'm hoping
That you'd realize and take me back inside
I'm broken
You were the only one holding my mind
I'm hoping
That you would bring me back to life

[Chorus]
You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my dreams
You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my...

[Verse]
You know that I know when you look in my eyes
Life's not the same when you're not by my side
No one I'd rather be spending my time
But loving you has slowly been taken my life
Know that we know that you won't make the time
You'll never revoke what you did to my mind
Take a step back and then you realize
The love that we had has been buried alive
[Chorus]
You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my dreams
You'll never know how much you mean to me
I'll never sleep without you in my dreams
