Killstation, Perplexion:i
[Verse 1]
Time and time again I've been so selfish
I don't wanna be this way, but I can't help it
We both wonder why this rainfall feels so endless
You can try, but I know that you won't forget this

[Chorus]
You never told me that our love was over
I know I'll never get a chance again
I never wanted to be growing colder
I'll be broken while you'll play pretend

[Verse 2]
You know you left me alone here under ground
You can't expect me to bleed without a sound
I wasn't ready to leave this goddamn town
My life is shit when you're not around

[Bridge]
You know you left me alone
You know you left me alone
You know you left me alone (you're not around)
You know you left me alone

[Chorus]
You never told me that our love was over
I know I'll never get a chance again
I never wanted to be growing colder
I'll be broken while you'll play pretend
You never told me that our love was over
I know I'll never get a chance again
I never wanted to be growing colder
I'll be broken while you'll play pretend
