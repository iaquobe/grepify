Killstation, Days Before Dying:i
[Intro]
I only
Understand the things I

[Chorus]
I know that you don't understand the things I do with my life
You're with another man, I'm overseas with you in my mind
I'm holding onto memories, I only need to survive
Before we rest in peace I hope you know our love never died
Our love never died
Our love never died
(The two of us are dying)
I know that you don't understand the things I do with my life
You're with another man, I'm overseas with you in my mind
I'm holding onto memories, I only need to survive
Before we rest in peace I hope you know our love never died
Our love never died
Our love never died
