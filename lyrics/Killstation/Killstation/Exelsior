Killstation, Exelsior:i
[Verse 1]
Drive me out now, tear my love down
Thinking out loud, let my thoughts drown
Break me down now, take my heart out
Run from your town, lost in my doubt
I know it's hard to leave the promise that I wish I made
I know it's hard to dream, you saw the world, I'm far away
More than what I need, believe me, I don't wanna wait
Know I'm gonna bleed, I'm proof enough the world will break

[Chorus]
I'm lost without your love
Don't trust the man I was
She was the only drug
That burned away my flaws
I'm lost without your love
Don't trust the man I was
She was the only drug
That burned away my flaws

[Bridge]
She burned away my flaws
You burned away my flaws
She burned away my flaws

[Verse 2]
Everything never could be like it was
I forgot, never saw
Living life without love was so dark, it's so real
Even under the sun I've been freezing
Believe me, I'm losing my trust
Never seen how you leave me, take my heart and run
I'll follow you forever until I catch up
Breaking me into pieces, you take what you want
Never thought I'd be dreaming of you for this long
[Outro]
So fucking long
Where have you gone?
I'm lost without your love
Where have you gone?
She was the only drug
That burned away my flaws
