Killstation, Fallen Angel:i
[Chorus]
I lose my focus
When I feel like I've been feeling lately
Revoke my hopelessness
I'll wait for you to come and save me
I'm so fucked up
Know there's nothing you can do to change it
You broke my trust, I'll never love another fallen angel

[Verse]
Take me where we can be all alone
Face my fear if we see where I'm wrong
Take your tears, you can weep when I'm gone
Make it clear that we need to move on

[Chorus]
I lose my focus
When I feel like I've been feeling lately
Revoke my hopelessness
I'll wait for you to come and save me
I'm so fucked up
Know there's nothing you can do to change it
You broke my trust, I'll never love another fallen angel
