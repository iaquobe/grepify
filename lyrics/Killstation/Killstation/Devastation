Killstation, Devastation:i
[Intro]
Through your window

[Chorus]
I looked in through your window and I saw you and him
The feeling that you don't know is waiting to begin

[Verse]
I don’t ever wanna be with you again
Holding everything together while you pretend
Hope the memories worth the pain you'll get
Tell the enemy forever I'll live with this

[Chorus]
I looked in through your window and I saw you and him
The feeling that you don’t know is waiting to begin

[Bridge]
Say my name, I drop it all
You're not the same when I'm around

[Chorus]
I looked in through your window and I saw you and him
The feeling that you don't know is waiting to begin
I looked in through your window and I saw you and him
The feeling that you don't know is waiting to begin

[Outro]
Holding everything together while you pretend
Hope the memories worth the pain you'll get
Tell the enemy forever I'll live with this
