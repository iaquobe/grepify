Killstation, Singing to You, in Your Grave:i
[Chorus]
The broken road has grown so old
I can't help, but pave it
I hope I find my way back home
Even though I hate it
Held back by all I've ever made
Fell back inside my hateful ways
You know my mind is bound to break
I'd rather die than wait for

[Bridge]
Everything to fade away
Until then I'll be singing to you in your grave
How many times I ran away
It just make me think of yesterday
Getting sick of drowning in her pain
She set me up and she put me in a cage

[Chorus]
The broken road has grown so old
I can't help, but pave it
I hope I find my way back home
Even though I hate it
Held back by all I've ever made
Fell back inside my hateful ways
You know my mind is bound to break
I'd rather die than wait for
