Killstation, Unconditional:i
[Chorus 1]
My love was unconditional
She was so damn promiscuous
I'm left with the residual
She makes me feel ridiculous

[Verse]
The darkest night
Is yet to come
I'm sick of light
Burn out the sun
Remove my eyes
Cut out my tongue
You made me blind
To sing this song

[Chorus 2]
I wore my heart on my sleeve for too long (For too long)
I'm torn apart at the seams, now I'm gone (Now I'm gone)
How far away will we be when I die? (When I die?)
It's hard to see when all I do is cry

[Chorus 1]
My love was unconditional
She was so damn promiscuous
I'm left with the residual
She makes me feel ridiculous
My love was unconditional
She was so damn promiscuous
I'm left with the residual
She makes me feel ridiculous
[Chorus 2]
I wore my heart on my sleeve for too long (For too long)
I'm torn apart at the seams, now I'm gone
How far away will we be when I die? (When I die?)
It's hard to see when all I do is cry
