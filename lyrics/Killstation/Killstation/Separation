Killstation, Separation:i
[Intro]
I hate computers, I play guitar
We've both been moving slow now

[Chorus]
We've both been moving slow now
I need to leave this old town
I'm on a lonely road now
You got so lost in my doubt

[Verse 1]
I never meant to let you down
I know you'd rather leave this town
I'm never falling to the ground
I need to tell you what I mean
I know I left you when you fell
I wanna turn this back around
I wish I had you with me now
I'd give you everything you need

[Verse 2]
Don't you want this love to last?
I know you're haunted by the past
Baby, don't act like the two of us
Can't escape from all the things we've done
Don't act like the two of us
I know you're haunted
(Know you're haunted)
Baby, don't act like the two of us
Can't escape from all, escape
(Escape this fucked up life)

[Chorus]
We've both been moving slow now
I need to leave this old town
I'm on a lonely road now
You got so lost in my doubt
