Killstation, Ascension:i
[Chorus]
I don't wanna run
But there’s fire in the sky
If you wanna be alright
Make a plan now in your mind
Know you've got a gun
Cock it back and hold it tight
Put it right between my eyes
Pull the trigger, take my life
Pull the trigger, take my life
Pull the trigger, take my life
(Take my life)

[Bridge]
Take my life
They built a wall up in the sky
They don't wanna be alright
Now there’s a fire in the sky
I don't wanna be alright

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run
But there's fire in the sky
If you wanna be alright
Make a plan now in your mind
Know you've got a gun
Cock it back and hold it tight
Put it right between my eyes
Pull the trigger, take my life
