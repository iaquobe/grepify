Killstation, Attraction:i
[Intro]
No other place
That I'd rather be
Bed tonight
There's no other place that I'd rather stay
Than inside your mind
â€”side your mind

[Chorus]
There's no other place that I'd rather be
Than right here with you in this bed tonight
There's no other place that I'd rather stay
Than inside your mind

[Verse]
I can't concentrate when I see your face
I just contemplate the time that I waste
I can't lose the memories that we've made
And I'll still be looking for the better days
With a bad taste left in my mouth from the way
That you left me here and went far away
There's part of me that I can't replace
She's the half of me that I need to save

[Chorus]
There's no other place that I'd rather be
Than right here with you in this bed tonight
There's no other place that I'd rather stay
Than inside your mind (your mind)
[Outro]
Your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Your mind
Mind, mind, mind
Mind, mind, mind
Mind, mind, mind
Mind
No other place
That I'd rather be
Bed tonight
