Killstation, Orbicularis:i
[Intro]
I only hope that you die before me
So you don't have to be all alone
She's the place that I call my home

[Chorus]
I only hope that you die before me
So you don't have to be all alone
I'll never know why she tries to ignore me
She's the place that I call my home

[Verse]
I got a problem with the way that I see things
It's like the fallen only faze when I'm dreaming
I can't recall the last I heard you breathing
I know we all wish that we'd kill your demons
My tears soak your words every time that I read them
You didn't deserve to be hurt for no reason
I followed the burn till I learned why you're bleeding
And that was what killed me, the pain wasn't needed
You set the world on fire
You'll never close your eyes
If love is your desire
Don't wait until I die

[Outro]
Till I die
The pain wasn't needed
You'll never close your eyes
If love is your desire
Don't wait until I die
Till I die
Till I die
