Killstation, Iota:i
[Chorus]
You left me behind, I don't know why
I cover my eyes and start to cry
You left me to die, I'm screaming "Why?!"
Wondering when you'll leave my mind
Why?
I don't know why
Cover my eyes
Why?
I don't
I don't know...
You left me behind, I don't know why
I cover my eyes and start to cry
You left me to die, I'm screaming "Why?!"
Wondering when you'll leave my mind
