Killstation, Stasis:i
[Chorus]
Don't waste my time
Don't break my mind
Don't take my life away
Don't tell me lies
I know you've tried
It's something I forgave
Don't waste my time
Don't break my mind
Don't tell me lies today
Come take my life
I know you try
It's something I can take

[Bridge]
You make me wanna get
My shit together now
You make me wanna get
My shit together now

[Chorus]
Don't waste my time
Don't break my mind
Don't take my life away
Don't tell me lies
I know you've tried
It's something I forgave
Don't waste my time
Don't break my mind
Don't tell me lies today
Come take my life
I know you try
It's something I can take
