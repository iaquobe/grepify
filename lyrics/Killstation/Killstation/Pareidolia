Killstation, Pareidolia:i
[Intro]
Underneath the fallen leaves
Time I spent, just you and me
Underneath the fallen leaves
No one else was meant to...

[Pre-Chorus]
Living fast, but I think that we should slow down
In the past, but I'm driving down the road all
Paralyzed, but I think that I should go now
Never crash and I don't even know how

[Chorus]
I won't pretend I don't need you
You know the shit that I've been through
My love cannot continue
I think of him when I see you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I think that we should slow down
In the past, but I'm driving down the road all
Paralyzed, but I think that I should go now
Never crash and I don't even know how

[Chorus]
I won't pretend I don't need you
You know the shit that I've been through
My love cannot continue
I think of him when I see you
[Verse]
Underneath the fallen leaves
Everything was meant to be
Time I spent, just you and me
No one else was meant to be

[Chorus]
I won't pretend I don't need you
You know the shit that I've been through
My love cannot continue
I think of him when I see you
I won't pretend I don't need you
You know the shit that I've been through
My love cannot continue
I think of him when I see you

[Outro]
Underneath the fallen leaves
Time I spent, just you and me
Underneath the fallen leaves
No one else was meant to...
