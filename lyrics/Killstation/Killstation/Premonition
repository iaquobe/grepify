Killstation, Premonition:i
[Chorus]
Dreaming of the time I spent with you
Left me with nothing I can do
I don't deserve to know the truth
Behind the lies I always knew
I lost myself when you left
You know you let me down
You told me with your last breath
I'll never leave this town
Dreaming of the time I spent with you
(Dreaming of the time I spent with you)
I don't deserve to know the truth
(I don't deserve to know)
Dreaming of the time I spent with you
You know you let me down
I don't deserve to know the truth
I'll never leave this town

[Bridge]
I lost myself when you left
You know you let me down
You told me with your last breath
I'll never leave this town

[Chorus]
Dreaming of the time I spent with you
Left me with nothing I can do
I don't deserve to know the truth
Behind the lies I always knew
I lost myself when you left
You know you let me down
You told me with your last breath
I'll never leave this town
