Killstation, Manipulation:i
[Chorus]
Somewhere in the back of my mind
There's a place that I hide
All the things that I despise about you
And how you breaking my mind
I been taking my time
I don’t think you decide, it's all—
Take the things that make me human
Time and time again you ruin everything
We had to do it
I don't need to feel so useless

[Bridge]
That make me human
To feel so useless

[Chorus]
Somewhere in the back of my mind
There’s a place that I hide
All the things that I despise about you
How you're breaking my mind
I been taking my time
I don't think you decide, it's all—
Take the things that make me human
Time and time again you ruin everything
We had to do it
I don't need to feel so useless
