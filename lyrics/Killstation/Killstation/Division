Killstation, Division:i
[Chorus]
Build me up and break my trust
But I don't need your love
I'll break you down and take your lies
But I won't need your love

[Bridge]
If every day is wasted, what have you been waiting for?
But I will never leave you, my heart will always be yours

[Verse]
If every day is wasted, what have you been waiting for?
I'll wait here forever till you walk back through the door
I told you that I'm miserable, you left me on the floor
But I will never leave you, my heart will always be yours
I don't need your love, but I won't need your love
I don't need your love, but I won't need your love
If every day is wasted, what have you been waiting for?
I'll wait here forever till you walk back through the door
