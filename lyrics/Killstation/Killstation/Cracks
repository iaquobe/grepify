Killstation, Cracks:i
[Intro: Joei Razook]
My dear, tell me your lies
My dear, tell me your...

[Verse 1: Joei Razook]
My dear, tell me your lies
Tell me your secrets like they haunt your nights
Wake up in tears and chase out the lights
From the sun in the window, the darkness feels right
But you're scared, you're still alive
My eyes on your eyes
Run your hands through the cracks in my life, don't let go
Only for your time, and trust in my word
I'll show you what it's worth, I'll pick my heart out the dirt

[Verse 2: Killstation]
Burning the memories deep in my mind
Burn down the structures that keep me alive
Tell me the reason you wasting my time
Tear down the walls that I'm buried behind
I never meant to be so fucking distant
When you not right next to me, something is missing
And all that I know is this is not my decision
And that's why I wrote this, I know that you'll listen

[Chorus: Killstation]
I know that you don't understand
You know that I won't call again
I know that you don't need a man
I tried but we don't stand a chance
[Outro]
Bill... why don't you tell her now, this minute?!
Yes, tell me, darling
Don't you think this is a rather odd place to discuss a personal matter?
You don't have to shout it out just say it soft and distinctly
