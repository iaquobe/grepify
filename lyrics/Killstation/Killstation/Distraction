Killstation, Distraction:i
[Intro]
Won't be making a sound
The way that you talk to me now

[Chorus]
You call my phone and tell me that you're around
You're on your own, I won't be making a sound
I can't believe the way you talk to me now
You've got to know you got your head in the ground

[Verse 1]
If I pick up then I'll start choking
Give me love or leave me hopeless
I don't wanna lose my focus
But I know that I've been broken

[Chorus]
You call my phone and tell me that you're around
You're on your own, I won't be making a sound
I can't believe the way you talk to me now
You've got to know you got your head in the ground

[Verse 2]
How could you just leave me here?
Bullshit you put in my ear
You can't seem to make it clear
I won't live my life in fear

[Chorus]
You call my phone and tell me that you're around
You're on your own, I won't be making a sound
I can't believe the way you talk to me now
You've got to know you got your head in the ground
You call my phone and tell me that you're around
You're on your own, I won't be making a sound
I can't believe the way you talk to me now
You've got to know you got your head in the ground

[Outro]
The ground, the ground, the ground
The ground, the ground
I won't be making a
The ground
Talk to me now
