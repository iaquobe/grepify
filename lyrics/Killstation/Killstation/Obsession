Killstation, Obsession:i
[Intro]
I'm never going home
Remember all I know
I'm on a broken road
I'm walking all alone

[Chorus 1]
Obsessed with how you look at me
Confess, I'll love you endlessly
I make these things so hard to see
You make me forget how to breathe

[Bridge]
You know I hate my jealousy
I don't know how I should be

[Chorus 2]
I'm never going home
Remember all I know
I'm on a broken road
I'm walking all alone
I'm never going home
Remember all I know
I'm on a broken road
I'm walking all alone

[Chorus 1]
Obsessed with how you look at me
Confess, I'll love you endlessly
I make these things so hard to see
You make me forget how to breathe

[Outro]
I'm never going home
Remember all I know
I'm on a broken road
I'm walking all alone
All alone, all alone
