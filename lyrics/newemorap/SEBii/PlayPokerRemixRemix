[Verse: GXMINI]
She just tried to fuck me
Shordie shouldve dubbed me
Saw it in your eyes
Always knew that you move funny
Every lie you told me
I just took it boldly
Never even questioned
But you tried to fuckin fold me
I just had your shordie on the ground
You know that like to put her down
She just wanna get it from the back
Shes a slut ill keep that shit a stack
She just tried to fuck me
Shordie shouldve dubbed me
Saw it in your eyes
Always knew that you move funny
Every lie you told me
I just took it boldly
Never even questioned
But you tried to fuckin fold me
