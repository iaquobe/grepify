100 gecs, hand crushed by a mallet (Remix) [feat. Fall Out Boy, Craig Owens, Nicole Dollanganger]:i
[Verse 1: Patrick Stump & 
Craig Owens
]
I was dying to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was dying to find a way to kill time (A way to kill time)
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go, go

[Chorus: Nicole Dollanganger]
Oh my god, what the fuck?
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the air
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun

[Verse 2: Craig Owens]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush
It's not enough
You fucked up your last try
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Verse 3: Craig Owens]
I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write at all
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too

[Outro: Craig Owens]
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
