100 gecs, toothless:i
[Intro]
Dylan Brady

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
I'm putting on your makeup, I don't have no money
Thinking of the way that you hurt me
All the ways you haunt me (Haunt me)
I don't wanna feel this way, no
You're the one who told me I could do it all
Okay, that's fine, I can take it in
I can get out of your way if that's really what you want
From me, right now
What you want from me, I don't know

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes (Laugh and make mistakes)
I don't think I can go and tell you
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes (Laugh and make mistakes)
I don't think I can go—

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Toothache when I wake up, feelin' really really hurt now
Wishin that I was toothless, but that's just 'til the boof hits
I don't wanna cry now, I want the diamonds
That's why I'm mining, t-to give 'em all to you
I was sittin' on the flight to the show (To the show, yeah)
I thought I'd always be broke (Be broke, yeah)
On the flight comin' home in the back of the plane
Realised I was wrong, but my heart never changed

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes
I don't think I can go and tell you
I'll never go away (Never go away)
I'll be here every day (I'll be here every day)
We'll laugh and make mistakes
I don't think I can go and tell you

[Outro: Laura Les]
You're jumping in, we'll both get through
I need you to hear what I'm thinking of you
Hear what I'm thinking of you
