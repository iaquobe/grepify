[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
27 missed calls lightin' up my cell phone
Sending you a text sayin', "Call you when I get home"
Taking off my work clothes, workin' in a cold one
45 group texts, 50 group DMs
Send another text askin' me if I've seen them
Pushin' back a deadline, gotta make my bedtime
Then I crack a smile, 'cause I love you and I'd do it all again

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Something's gotta work this time
It's my way of trying to let you know
I've got a little thing for you
I've got a little crush or somethin'
Maybe I'm just drunk as fuck
I customize my ringtone
But it's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
It was always you
Put it on vibrate when I'm with you (With you)
Talkin' to myself again (Again)
Falling on broken glass
29 missed calls, never leave the basement
I don't wanna tell you what I'm really thinking (What I'm thinking)
Thinking, what I'm really thinking
Thinking, what I'm really thinking

[Bridge: Dylan Brady]
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick
Used to love that ringtone when you called me
Now it makes me sick (Sick, sick)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Outro: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer
