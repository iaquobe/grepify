Capoxxo, It Was Beautiful:i
[Verse 1]
Oh, and I'm so alone, it's not even funny
I just wanna know, do you really care for me at all?
Do you really care for me at— ahem
Would you pick up your phone if gave you a call?
And I just really want to know
If you wanna hit the road
With me and all my friends
We can pop some Percs and smoke some dope
Oh
Love is nothing but a simulation, crazy
I just wanna have you in my station baby
We can pop Percs, we can turn up, oh
I just wanna have you in the bathroom stall
Woah
Do you even care for me at all?

[Chorus]
Probably not, that's fine, I guess so
I been mixing red wine with the XO
Yeah, I really don't care at all
Life is just an RPG, yeah, that's final

[Verse 2]
One day you gon' see me on your TV
You been sneaking on my Instagram, creepy
I know that you wish that you could be me
I-I-I-I-I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
Probably not, that's fine, I guess so
I been mixing red wine with the XO
Yeah, I really don't care at all
Life is just an RPG, yeah, that's final

[Outro]
One day you gon' see me on your TV
One day you gon' see me— one day you gon'—
Life is just an RPG, yeah, that's final
