Rudeclub

[Chorus: oaf1]
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive

[Verse 1: Capoxxo]
Yeah, broke me, it must be you ain't know me
We were out in Italy sipping champagne in Gucci
Do you, wanna fall apart with me?
We can do drugs, get fucked in the backseat
I don't, even wanna know your name
Because I, know you'll just bring me home
Know you'll just bring me home
You're just— You're just—

[Chorus: oaf1]
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive

[Verse 2: dreamcache]
Moon rocks, going supernova
I'ma keep going till the game is over
I blacked out, that's record time
But it's okay, baby, I'll be fine
Me and the gang be crossing over
Rocks on my chest, they look like boulders
People on the internet hate my life
But I don't really give a fuck, aaahhh

[Chorus: oaf1]
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive
Perfect, baby tell me that I'm worth it
I be off the drugs, girl I need you and it's urgent
Perfect, everything just fits so perfect
I be off the drugs, and I'm slumped I'm speaking cursive (Cursive)
