Capoxxo, Monster:i
[Chorus: 
Meg & Dia
]
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows

[Chorus]
Monster, how-how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, h-how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, look-looking through the windows

[Bridge]
That night hе caged her, bruised and brokе her
He struggled closer, then-then-then he stole her
Violet wrists and then her ankles, silent-silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

[Chorus: 
Meg & Dia & Capoxxo
, Capoxxo]
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how-how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, h-how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, look-looking through the windows

[Bridge]
That night he caged her, bruised and broke her
He struggled closer, then-then-then he stole her
Violet wrists and then her ankles, silent-silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

[Chorus: 
Meg & Dia & Capoxxo
, Meg & Dia]
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here, looking through the windows
