oaf1, its hard :/:i
[Intro]
I can't do this any—

[Chorus]
Take everything from me, don't care 'bout this money
I just need you by me, need you right beside me
I remember watching the sunset, my world, it got darker
My life, is it done yet? Wrap it up like a spider

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, I know that it's hard to be with me
And I've been trying so hard to be what you need

[Verse]
I had to take a walk, I'm nervous, wonder when you're comin' back
And I can feel the distance growing, was it something that I said?
You make me feel like I'm important, not just something to forget
Without you girl my life is boring, hope this moment never ends
Smile, I know that life hurts, but we'll be alright in the end
And baby this cycle: think of you over and over and over and over again

[Bridge]
Girl, you make my head hurt, we should be together
Do you think of me ever? I wanna show you you're special

[Chorus]
Take everything from me, don't care 'bout this money
I just need you by me, need you right beside me
I remember watching the sunset, my world, it got darker
My life, is it done yet? Wrap it up like a spider

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, I know that it's hard to be with me
And I've been trying so hard to be what you need
