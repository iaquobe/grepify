oaf1, gas pedal:i
[Verse 1: oaf1]
Me and cache in the stu'
We just speakin' our truth on the beat right now
Baby, please don't move, I just feel so in tune with my chi right now
I am in the V off an E or like two
​oaf1, dreamcache in the back, what it do
Baby, I been feelin' sticky, I just ate glue
I am with my dogs and we howl at the moon

[Hook: oaf1]
​oaf1, dreamcache, told her throw it back
Touch down, I just splashed
Swag, poppin' tags
Ripped black jeans, 300, they fit bad
I just popped like three pills and now I feel bad
I just hopped up in the whip swervin', I hope I crash
Shawty blown me a kiss, fuck it, I'm blowin' back
I'm 'bout to dip, baby, and that's a fact

[Verse 2: dreamcache]
Lil' biddy in the back of the limo rollin' Lizzos or some crackpack lookin' like a snack
How you rock Raf and stay lookin' so wack?
Big oaf, big cache goin' in on the track
It's-
It's a room full of boppers, I’m sad
Trues lookin' false on a lame and I’m mad
And I didn’t miss your call I was busy poppin' tags
I don’t wanna chat, I need you to make it clap

[Hook: oaf1]
O-o-oaf1, dreamcache, told her throw it back
Touch down, I just splashed
S-s-s-swag, poppin' tags
Ripped black jeans, 300, they fit bad
I just popped like three pills and now I feel bad
I just hopped up in the whip swervin', I hope I crash
Shawty blown me a kiss, fuck it, I'm blowin' back
I'm 'bout to dip, baby, and that's a fact
