oaf1, wait 4 it:i
[Chorus: oaf1]
I'm just waiting for the day you break my heart again
I know I should’ve played it cool but I was singing for the feds
If you want to, girl I want you, we could start again
Wait for it, wait for it
I-I-I-I-I I know that you don't need me, but baby I need y-o-o-o-ou
And I'm breaking to pieces, somebody get the glue
Your love’s just paralyzing, how I break you through
Wait for it, wait for it

[Bridge: oaf1]
Do you know what I wonder?
All the things you touch just turn the weather to summer
God what a bummer
Can't you just give me one thing?
Just gimme this one thing
Lemme turn you to nothing

[Verse 1: oaf1]
It happened so fast, eyes rolled back, sight goes black
Dreams fall flat, I know you saw that
And I was so back, didn't cover my tracks
(I should've covered my tracks)
You make me feel so bad

[Chorus: oaf1]
I'm just waiting for the day you break my heart again
I know I should've played it cool but I was singing for the feds
If you want to, girl I want you, we could start again
Wait for it, wait for it
I-I-I-I-I I know that you don't need me, but baby I need y-o-o-o-ou
And I'm breaking to pieces, somebody get the glue
Your love’s just paralyzing, how I break you through
Wait for it, wait for it

[Verse 2: Capoxxo]
You can be my shiny star, oh
I know that life is hard, oh
Dying in the dark, oh
And we were chilling in the fort, alone
Did you forget my name? And would you like a clue?
And let me in the dream, I slept there in the dark
I have been thinking ’bout you, it's not nothing new to you
Wait for it, die for it

[Chorus: oaf1]
I’m just waiting for the day you break my heart again
I know I should've played it cool but I was singing for the feds
If you want to, girl I want you, we could start again
Wait for it, wait for it
I-I-I-I-I I know that you don't need me, but baby I need y-o-o-o-ou
And I'm breaking to pieces, somebody get the glue
Your love’s just paralyzing, how I break you through
Wait for it, wait for it

[Outro: Capoxxo]
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh oh
