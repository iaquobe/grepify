oaf1, doing it wrong:i
[Intro: oaf1 and Daft Punk]
Aha, I'm so gone
Ahem, I'm on my phone
Aha, I hate this song, aha, do-o-o-o-QUIET!
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right (Let's go)
Everybody will be— (Oaf1)

[Verse 1: oaf1]
Oh my god, bitch, I'm so off it
I be pourin' up, girl, you never catch me coughin'
Kiss me while I count it, co-c-c-c-count it (Oaf)
She don't really like me but she really like my outfit
I just smoked a bat to the face
I am walking with my bros in the rain
Girl, you look just like a ghost through the screen
I don't think you ever know what I mean
Wha-wha-wha-what I mean

[Chorus: oaf1]
Aha, I'm so gone
Ahem, I'm on my phone
Aha, I hate this song
Aha, I do it wrong (I'm doing it wrong)
Aha, I'm so gone (I'm so gone)
Ahem, I'm on my phone (On my phone)
Aha, I hate this song (Hate this song)
Aha, I do it wrong

[Verse 2: dreamcache]
(Dreamcache)
I'm spillin' it on my shirt, I'm fuckin' everybody's night up
I'm gettin' to work, I cannot show out if it's light out
Why is she tryna flirt? Really not feelin' it right now
I'm steady sippin' on dirt, me and my bros tryna die (D-D-D-Dreamcache)
Fuckin' rocks on my jeans hurt, and it's weighin' me down
Fuckin' heavy with that leisure, I stay sleepin' on em
Mixin' liters of seizure, I'm just tryna stay calm
Ch-Christian, I'm rockin' clean, I-I don't fuck with this so-o-o-o-ong

[Verse 3: oaf1]
(Oaf)
Me and Dreamcache smokin' out the fiend pack
It's like a movie, you should go and see that
Swag at the IMAX, I don't check the price tag
I know you like that, l-l-like that

[Chorus: oaf1]
Aha, I'm so gone (I'm so gone)
Ahem, I'm on my phone (On my phone)
Aha, I hate this song (Hate this song)
Aha, I do it wrong (I'm doing it wrong)
Aha, I'm so gone (I'm so gone)
Ahem, I'm on my phone (On my phone)
Aha, I hate this song (Hate this song)
Aha, I do it wrong (Yeah, wrong)

[Outro: Daft Punk]
Doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight
Doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doin' it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight
