And if there were no more songs about her
Making me wish that I'd get to come inside
Whole song wit' you later
Used to be happy, do you remember?

[Chorus]
Getting love from all the thots now
(Oh, I love you girl) But you're the only one I think about
(Oh, I love you girl) And now I'm up, I can't stop lookin' down
(Oh, I love you girl) I think of happy things when you're around
(Oh, I love you girl) But what you said to me
(Oh, I love you girl) Changed everything
(Oh, I love you girl) The anxiety
(Oh, I love you girl) Got the best of me

(Oh, I love you girl)
Oh, I love you girl (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I love you girl (Oh)
Oh, I love you girl (Hold on to me)
Oh, I love you girl ([?])
Oh, I love you girl (I won't say that)
Oh, I love you girl ([?])
