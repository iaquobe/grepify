oaf1, poster:i
[Chorus]
I popped a pill and now my throat hurts, the sewer of the mind
You wanna buy it? I'm the owner, you're gonna have to get in line
And I was hanging like a poster, I wanna see if I can fly
I want you to send a postcard, f-from the other side

[Verse]
Why don't you come a little closer? I promise I won't bite
I'll put you in a folder, I'll keep you in my mind
Ca-Can you feel it getting colder? I'll take you to the fire
And if you took me to the slaughter, I don't think I would fight

[Chorus]
I popped a pill and now my throat hurts, the sewer of the mind
You wanna buy it? I'm the owner, you're gonna have to get in line
And I was hanging like a poster, I wanna see if I can fly
I want you to send a postcard, f-from the other side

[Outro]
And I was hanging like a poster (P-P-P-P-Poster)
Hanging like a poster (P-Poster)
I was hanging like a poster (P-P-P-Poster)
Hanging like a poster (P-P-P-Poster)
And I was hanging like a poster (P-Poster)
Hanging like a poster (P-P-Poster)
And I was hanging like a poster (P-Poster)
Hanging like a poster (Po-Poster)
Hanging like a poster
