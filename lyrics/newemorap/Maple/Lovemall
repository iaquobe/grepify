[Intro: Night Lovell]
Mhm, umm, umm
Oh, ooh, whoa
Yeah-e-yeah (yeah)
Yeah-e-yeah, yeah (*ahem*, yeah)
Oh, ooh, whoa, oh (yeah)
*Ahem*, one more time
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (ooh)

[Chorus: Night Lovell]
I know she a goddess, yuh
I know that she got it, yuh
I study the sonics, yuh
You're scared of her promise, yuh
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy
Where's my guidance? Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1: Night Lovell]
5 AM, ridin' with my team (ooh, yuh)
Talkin' hella shit like they've never seen her
I've been gone for a minute on the East-Side
Feelin' like I've never seen her
Baby, what you tryna get from me?
All the power that you took from me
I'll still love you to the death, man
Even when you're with the next man
Throw us back to the first night
I got your trust in my left hand
Take your ass to the bedroom
Finesse the pussy with my right hand (yuh, ooh)
Oh, man, oh, oh, man
I wanna fuck you in the caravan
Drunk thots in the caravan
Fake bitch with a spray tan
They say, "Lovell, I want you back", yuh
I tell 'em only for a rack, yuh
Got the Benz in the back, yuh
Niggas call me with a strap, yuh
Off a Xanny for the night, yuh
Half a day late for the flight, yuh
Check, check, check, check, check
For the first threat on sight, yuh (ooh)

[Interlude: Nessly & Night Lovell]
Yeah, ooh
Oh, yeah, ooh (yuh)
Ayy (ooh)

[Verse 2: Nessly]
Black on Black Phantom, I would pull up in it (yuh)
Tug your head up, I put a bullet in it (yuh)
Niggas always screamin', "Gang, gang"
But they're not gang, I knew he wasn't with it (yuh)
Protect all the peace and silence (ooh)
I pray that these niggas get guidance (ooh)
She top me while I move the mileage (ooh)
Religious, 'cause my bitch a goddess (yeah)
In the 6, gettin' throat like a lozenge (yeah)
My cell phone switch to Rogers (yeah)
Ain't no cash then don't bother to call me (yeah)
Ain't no digits then it don't involve me (yeah)
All these lead's [?] rob me (yeah)
If you burnin', can't trip in the lobby (yeah)
My stitches and zippers, it's Balmain (yeah)
Pour lean up and sip it like coffee (yeah)

[Bridge: Nessly & Night Lovell]
You shouldn't have got me so lit
You, pull up to your function
You, really with the fuck shit? (pew)
One call, that's it
One night and I hit
One time and I quit
Rick Owens with the zip
Rick James, I'm rich (ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Night Lovell & Nessly]
I know she a goddess, yuh
I know that she got it, yuh (ooh)
I study the sonics, yuh
You're scared of her promise, yuh (oh, yeah)
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy (ooh)
Where's my guidance? Yuh, ayy
Whe-where's my guidance? Yuh

[Outro: Nessly]
Oh, yeah, ooh
Ye-ye-yeah, ooh
