Deko, Twilight City:i
[Chorus]
Welcome to Twilight City
Where they say dreams come true if you're with me
Stars shine bright so the sky's never empty
I feel the energy rising within me

Oh did I forget to mention?
This is the beginning of my ascension
Shaking that booty she want some attention
All of the enemieS try to avenge him
Standing at foot of my grave with intention
I see the hate, they just see the cringin'
Straight to the top on a whole 'nother vision
Taking the throne - that's including retention

[Verse 1]
I'm back to bed again
Bitch I'm a 5 star meal
Don't act like I'm Bennigan's, gotta have that rock-star appeal
I just be spinnin' shit
Shoutout to Larry 'cause I pulled my leg out running through them bands again (Did that shit again?)

[Bridge]
I guess I'll never learn
I'm just waking up and making music waiting for my turn
Say my money revolution while the good sativa burns
My shit is natural, I don't need a perm. (Perm)
But it don't make no sense (Uh-huh)
I can not do this shit (Okay)
I will not wait for me (Alright)
[?]
Huh, ayy woah
Every single place we go
We blowing up like C4
Fly like eagle, not a seagull (Umm)

[Chorus]
Welcome to Twilight City
Where they say dreams come true if you're with me
Stars shine bright so the sky's never empty
I feel the energy risin' within me
Oh did I forget to mention
This is the beginning of my ascension
Shaking that booty she want some attention
[?]
Standing a foot in my grave with intention
I see the [?] they just see the cringin'
Straight to the top then I'm [?]
Taking the throne - that's including retention
