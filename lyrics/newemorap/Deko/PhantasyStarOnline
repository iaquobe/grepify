[Verse 1: Deko]
Rather be all by myself like I'm Gilligan
I see the bitches, they lookin they feelin' it
I play the beat and lil Yameii, she killin' it
Look up and I swear I do not see ceiling man
Most of these rappers, they're sweet like it's cinnamon
I'm with a bitch and we deep in Dominican
Talkin' that cash, but it's not legitimate
Doin' the dash, I feel the adrenaline
I might just go and sell all of my fake—asy
Bitch, I'm online like a mofuckin fantasy
Why is she buryin' me in the Henessey
Wait 'till I get way too fucked up, yeah, we finna see
Cyber my life with the lights in the studio
I get a bag and fuck with a groupie hoe
Running a pack, then I feel like Julio
Bitch, I knew I was the shit since an embryo, yeah

[Chorus: Yameii Online & Deko]
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy, sy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—, ooh), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Ha, ha, ha, sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Huh, yeah

[Verse 2: Deko & Yameii Online]
Riding around in a truck in the parking lot (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
I want the neck, but that lil biddy talk a lot (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
She eat the dick like a mofuckin' lollipop (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
I took that lil biddy bitch to the candy shop (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Most of them thin like a mofuckin' pocky stick (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Covered in gold like I brought my own hockey stick (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
I make it go and I'm stayin' on top of it (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Kissin' yo bitch and I let her on top of it (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
I'm on the top like an eagle on Donovan
Addin' a word in a whole 'nother providence
Lacking effort, but I maintain the dominance
All these bitches lookin', giving me confidence
Don't feel like I should explain this, it's common sense
I took a trip to a whole different continent
Ice on mojito, I count up the commas bitch
Fuck do you mean, start an apocalypse
Me and the bros are hanging like ornaments
Cyber my life, I’ll catch you in a tournament
Rocking the Bape, bitch, I'm worth more than that
You took a lot, but you just subordinate
Drip on my neck with a Burberry cardigan
They run a wave, lil biddy, we started it
Got me fucked up if you think you're a part of it
Turn up the bass, I'm finna bombard a bitch (Yeah)

[Chorus: Yameii Online & Deko]
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, yeah, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta- (Sy, sy, sy, ooh, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Ooh, sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)
Be my— (Ooh, sy, sy, sy, sy, fantas—), see my new fanta— (Sy, sy, sy, sy)

[Outro: Yameii Online]
