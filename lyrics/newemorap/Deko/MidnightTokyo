Deko, Midnight Tokyo:i
[Chorus: Yameii Online & Deko]
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a nightmare baby low-key
But it's okay, okay, yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a nightmare baby low-key
But it's okay, okay, yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a- it's a- it's a-
It's a nightmare baby low-key -ey -ey -ey
But it's okay, okay, yeah yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a- it's a- it's a-
It's a nightmare baby low-key -ey -ey -ey
But it's okay, okay, yeah yeah
Okay, okay

[Verse: Deko]
I said dance
Baby, fuckin' dance
I just wanna dance
In Japan, baby hold my hand
I can't wait for France
One day I'ma be the man, I'ma be the man, okay
Fly like Peter Pan
Run like cheetah can, always
But I tried to start it
Ride around town in a matrix star ship
When she lookin' at me
I can guarantee that pussy so clean
See me, I've been smackin' cheeks
I've been making beats, all week
I'm a fucking geek
Shawty like my freak (Lil' freak)
Meet me in the sheets
Ride that shit on beat
Then repeat
She cannot sleep 'til that pussy beat
Yah, yeet
And that neck hit, like it's karate
And my bitch hot as fuck, like wasabi (Yuh)
Tokyo, touch down in the lobby
Star ship ready for take off, copy
Ready for take off, copy
Ready for take off, copy
Ready for take off, copy
Ready for take off

[Chorus: Yameii Online & Deko]
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a nightmare baby low-key
But it's okay, okay, yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a nightmare baby low-key
But it's okay, okay, yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a- it's a- it's a-
It's a nightmare baby low-key -ey -ey -ey
But it's okay, okay, yeah yeah
Okay, okay
Got a luck that coming on me
It's a- it's a- it's a-
It's a nightmare baby low-key -ey -ey -ey
But it's okay, okay, yeah
Okay, okay
