CMTEN, DATING AND DEPRESSION:i
[Verse 1]
Clouded windows hug a foggy sky
City lights illuminate your eyes
Smoking trees, passing cars roll by
Blowing smoke at people who give us a dirty eye
Haunted by the things I may have missed
Like my stupid brain remembering the times we kissed
Why can't I think of us and reminisce
Instead I lose my cool, and call my mom to calm my shit
Taking pills to help me stay alive
'Cause unbeknownst to most
I've never felt so sad inside
Wish we were sitting on a ferris wheel ride
Instead I'm crying in my room and now I want to die
Pencil broken as I throw a fit
Numbness overtakes me as I sit
Crying on your pillow like a dick
I wish that my mind was so sick

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is breathe the air between you and me
I know I can't have you now
'Cause I got too drunk and I fucked this up
And all I wanna do is see
The face you made when I kissed your cheek
I know I can't have you now, but I wanted to know
If you miss me, miss me

[Post-Chorus]
But I wanted to know, if you miss me, miss me

[Verse 2]
Running out of things to say to you
Wishing it could always be us two
Remember the night that I said
I'd do anything you asked me, if you didn't leave my side
Kiss me and I finally take a breath
But it's not fair to bring you to the steps
Of hell below and heaven on your left
Got all these thoughts of romance
Mixing with my thoughts of death
I want you like nothing I ever knew
'Cause when you hold my hand
I get a whole new point of view
You make me smile like a kid at the zoo
But only till I'm cognizant of everything you've been through
In love but, I'm always filled with dread
Today I spent a little too much time in bed
Push you away before I get to the edge
How can I love another, when I want myself dead?

[Chorus] x2
All I wanna do is breathe the air between you and me
I know I can't have you now
'Cause I got too drunk and I fucked this up
And all I wanna do is see
The face you made when I kissed your cheek
I know I can't have you now, but I wanted to know
If you miss me, miss me
