Here is the future (Future, future)

[Hook: Yung Skayda]
I-I dress like I'm in Jet Set (God damn, Go-God)
Knock a pussy out just like a bed set (Sheesh)
I feel like a GG with my headset
De-De-De-De-De-De-De-De-Death is your kismet (Right)

Knock a pussy out just like a bed set (Sheesh)

De-De-De-De-De-De-Death is your kismet (Right)

[Verse 1: Yung Skayda]
Carrots up on carrots up on diamonds, that's appeal shit
Scaring all your parents, when the mic switch on I kill sh-shit
They see my guitar amps, baby-girl, know that's my kill switch (Right)
They see all my followers like, baby, that's a hit list
Heard you bought a white tee? (I'ma turn that shit r-red)
I be popping white teeth (That shit put my ass to bed)
Oh, yeah, he don't like me 'cause I fucked his wifey
Yeah, she wanna ride me, ouu, I think she like me
Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Molly rocks in my green tea
(A-A-A-A-A-Ah) XIX is the dream team
Be silent when I'm speaking
I'm the shit, I'm the feces (He-Hey)

[Verse 2: Karm the Tool]
T-T-T-Two bad bitches and they kissing on my dick
MMD in a zip and I got it for the zip
You talking 'bout molly, huh? (Molly) Molly, huh? (Molly)
I ain't come here for no Molly (Uh)
I put that bitch on a dolly
He tryna chill, he not my kemosabe, uh
Ollie, huh, ollie, huh
All of my niggas get gnarly, huh
Met up with a bitch, took her straight to the crib
Now she riding my dick like a Harley, huh
Ha-Ha-Haha, y'all think it's funny?
Then I should kill all of you
Born, he made it the hard way
Get your bets down, ladies and gentlemen (Future)
