[Intro]
F-F-FROMTHEHEART

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you look so pretty in that dress, but I'd look better
I gave you everything I ever had, even my sweater
My mood is always shitty like North Carolina weather
Saying that you better than my ex, but have you met her?

[Chorus]
There's this girl named Astrid, never knows what's happening
She does whatever all her friends want to, that's without asking
I really don't wanna grow up to be alone in a mansion
Her friends don't really like her, oh my God, I can't imagine
There's this girl named Astrid, never knows what's happening
She does whatever all her friends want to, that's without asking
I really don't wanna grow up to be alone in a mansion
Her friends don't really like her, oh my God, I can't imagine

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you reminisce about me or the past?
I'm stuck inside my head, should be stuck inside my bag
And you saying all this shit about me, calling me this and that
And everything that works for me, it never seems to last
And oh, my goodness gracious
I've never been good at all the cheap flirtations
And I feel like a puppet-controlled animation
And I've never been good at holding conversations

[Chorus]
There's this girl named Astrid, never knows what's happening
She does whatever all her friends want to, that's without asking
I really don't wanna grow up to be alone in a mansion
Her friends don't really like her, oh my God, I can't imagine
There's this girl named Astrid, never knows what's happening
She does whatever all her friends want to, that's without asking
I really don't wanna grow up to be alone in a mansion
Her friends don't really like her, oh my God, I can't imagine
