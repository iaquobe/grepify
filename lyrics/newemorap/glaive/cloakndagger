glaive, cloak n dagger:i
[Verse 1: glaive]
Called me last week and said you're proud of me
How would I know the monster that you're 'bout to be?
Scrolling through, see a text that I should never see
I'm not lying when I said that you're dead to me

[Chorus: glaive]
So fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell
I know you never cared, but I'm still doing well
I got a lotta stories now that I'll never tell
And I hope you never see the light of day in a cell
So fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell
I know you never cared, but I'm still doing well
I got a lotta stories now that I'll never tell
And I hope you never see the light of day in a cell

[Verse 2: ericdoa]
Whoa, whoa
My bad, upset I missed your call
You got your arms out to save me
You hoping that I don't fall again
But it's too hard (Too hard, too hard)
To fall for you again
I try to be nice to you
And I have the right to prove
That I won't be good for you
Conversation was overdue
I try to be nice to you
And I have the right to prove
That I won't be good for you
Conversation was overdue

[Chorus: glaive]
So fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell
I know you never cared, but I'm still doing well
I got a lotta stories now that I'll never tell
And I hope you never see the light of day in a cell
So fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell
I know you never cared, but I'm still doing well
I got a lotta stories now that I'll never tell
And I hope you never see the light of day in a cell
