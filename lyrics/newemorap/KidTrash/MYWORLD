Kid Trash, MY WORLD:i
[Intro]
Welcome to my world
Kid Trash
High School Undead: Season 1

[Chorus]
Shawty, welcome to my world
I bought my bitch a Gucci purse
Think that bitch gave me a curse
I think that bitch gave me a curse

Finna wake up in a hearse
I gotta wake up and rehearse
I live a popstar life
Hope the drugs don't make it worse

Shawty, welcome to my world
I bought my bitch a Gucci purse
Think that bitch gave me a curse
I think that bitch gave me a curse

Finna wake up in a hearse
I gotta wake up and rehearse
I live a popstar life
Hope the drugs don't make it worse

[Verse 1]
I think the drugs gon' make it worse
I'ma have to make it work
I just bought my bitch a Dolce & Gabbana purse
Fuck the feds, till I end up in the dirt
I don't think she love me, she just really love my world
(Welcome to my world)

Popstar, I'm on MTV
If you wanna be an angel, shawty, follow me
I got drugs on me, I got cuts on me
She hang up on me, now she fuck on me, yeah

I don't wanna face life, I wanna face coke
I can hear your voice in the echoes
Shawty got me crying on the TracFone
Shawty...

[Chorus]
Shawty, welcome to my world
I bought my bitch a Gucci purse
Think that bitch gave me a curse
I think that bitch gave me a curse
Finna wake up in a hearse
I gotta wake up and rehearse
I live a popstar life
Hope the drugs don't make it worse (4x)
