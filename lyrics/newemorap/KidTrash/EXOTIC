Kid Trash, EXOTIC:i
[Chorus]
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas

[Verse]
I'm smoking on this gnarly shit
And I just copped some Prada shit
These pants cost me a rocketship
But I be wanting all of it
I'm smoking on this diesel
Red eyes, I'm looking evil
Stunting like Knievel
I'm stunting like Knievel
Stunting like I'm Jackass
My bitch she got a fat ass
I hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back, but
Love you like the drugs that I keep in my backpack
Love you like the drugs that I keep in my backpack

[Chorus]
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic
Don't ask me where I got it
I buy expensive products
And I just copped me some Pradas
I'm sipping on exotic-
