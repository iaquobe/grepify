Yameii Online, Take Wrisks:i
[Chorus: Yameii]
Sometimes I wonder why my life's like this
Fuck that, no cap, I'm out here taking risks
I wonder why my life's like this

[Verse: Deko]
Huh, and a cool mans out with a bad bitch
And she cold, so I get a bitch a jacket
Take her to the car, heat it up, then I beat her like a savage
Wanna get tacos? Yeah bitch
Swear to god drunk, ate dick, call it margarita magic
I'm about to blow up this shit
Can't contain me like I run around with a hatchet
I'ma start a fire like a pocket full of matches
Happens, when I wanna live, so lavish
Lately I feel like I'm uncollectable
Fuckin these bitches and they delectable
Smokin that gas, but I gotta let it go, um

[Chorus: Yameii]
Sometimes I wonder why my life's like this
Fuck that, no cap, I'm out here taking risks
Risks, risks, risks
