[Chorus: Yungster Jack]
U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-Under pressure (Pressure)
N-N-N-N-N-Nitemare pack (Packy), I'm smokin' pressure
Uh, I-I-I-I'm a bag getter (Baggy)
If it's fuck me then fuck you, it's for the better (You)
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-In the basement (Basement)
A-A-All up in her mouth like some braces
A-A lot of the bullshit on the table, nice arrangement
I-I-I don't want you to talk to me l-like I'm gamin' (

[Interlude: David Shawty]
David
Talk to me, don't talk (
David
)
Talk to me, don't talk (
D-D-Da—
)
Talk to me, don't talk (
David
)
Don't talk (
D—
)

[Verse 1: David Shawty]
I like being sticky 'cause I'm tacky
Put the apples and the berries in a basket (
D-Da—
)
I might make some shit but I'ma trash it
I don't wanna live, bro, you can have it (Ha)
Put th—put the fucks that I give inside a chamber
Said she wanna hang with me like t-shirts hangin' on a hanger
You cross me one more time then you might just be in danger
Empty cups on the desk, I'm just desperate for a buzz (
Da—
)
Flea market, buy some trading cards with gold doubloons
I just popped like half a pill and then I snorted two
Act just like a bitch, don't be surprised when I'm ignoring you
Take the ball away and put it in, I had to score on you (Fa-fa)
Sorry I had to
T-t-talkin' crazy that's a bad move
Nitemare got me stuck like a statue
I want this shit forever like a tattoo
Be careful, don't pass out from the gas fumes (
Da-David
)

[Verse 2: Yungster Jack]
(Yungster Jack)
Be careful
Rollin' off some shit at the park like a skateboard
She gave me third base, we're not playing baseball
Shaun White my Mastercard, winter games, that eight-ball
Feel like a professor, I got so much chalk
Feel like a professor, let me show you how to get to this guap
I got Ethika on my dick, I got Erika on my dick
Put a hairbrush in your… (Ah)
Smokin' USB, don't need a Bic (Pa—)
F-F-Fly on the wall, won't get flicked (Won't get flicked)
Don't ask me to be in your flick (Fli—)
I told her to bust down just like a Glick
I'ma delete her number, I'ma burn me a bridge
 (
