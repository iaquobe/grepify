Yng Hstlr, Hope You Die:i
[Intro]
I will seek for your love baby
I will seek for your love baby
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Chorus]
She cut so deep
I cannot bleed
Your love is what I need
For it and I am a fiend
You coke, I'm Charlie Sheen
She look me in my eyes and lie
I hope that this bitch die
Can I go back in time
I wasted all my time

[Verse]
Pray to god to change you but he never answer
Devil happy cus to my life you’re a cancer
Baby tell me why you like that I need answers
All the shit you told me
It don't even matter no more
No no no no no more
Hate the one I adore
Don't love you anymore
No no no no more
I hate the one I adore

[Chorus]
She cut so deep
I cannot bleed
Your love is what I need
For it and I am a fiend
You coke, I’m Charlie Sheen
She look me in my eyes and lie
I hope that this bitch die
Can I go back in time
I wasted all my time
