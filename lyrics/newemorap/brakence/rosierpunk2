[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along for me
(One, two, three, and)

[Verse 1]
Think I'm dreamin'
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned that someone else gon' need you more

[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me
(Oh, oh)
(
Who are you?
)

[Verse 2]
And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
He didn't answer me
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages
I left on read
Oh, and I took you to rosier
'Cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean
I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope
And I tossed that away for a seratone

[Chorus]
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me
(Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
No commitments
I'm going to hell, you're going to heaven
It doesn't negate our holy connection
And next time I fly too close to the sun
I'm not gonna run, this shit was for fun

[Verse 3]
(
Fifty, fifty, fifty
)
I left home now I'm fucked up
Realized how much I loved you
Whole god damn life, been a suck-up
Now I'm just tryna get my luck up
All the pain went when you kissed me
We were ten toes up, now I'm six feet down
Moved on, you don't need me now
Now I gotta figure me out
Uh! 
Brakence
No, I gotta figure me out, oh-ooh, yeah, uh
Bitch, I'm up next
Fuckboy ain't a threat
Put a price on my head
Won't sell my soul for a check
That's on God, that's on sound
You won't ever see me 'round
I'll be cookin' up some shit that'll probably get me out this town

[Outro]
So far, are these visual things the only effect you find?
