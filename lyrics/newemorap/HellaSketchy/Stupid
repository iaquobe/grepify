Hella Sketchy, Stupid:i
[Intro]
Rollin' with a stick, all extended clips
Jackets, hollow tips, she gon' lick the tip
Porsche all black
Hit it from the back

[Chorus]
Choppa go stupid like a retard
Swipe 'em all down like a key card
Why you flex so much in a cheap car?
Racin' out the lot in a Beamer
Rollin' with a stick, all extended clips
Jackets, hollow tips, she gon' lick the tip
Porsche all black
Hit it from the back

[Verse 1]
Codeine demon, fiend for the Wock
Wake up in the morning, pop a bean and count my guap
If you testin' me, I'll pull up with a green dot
Tired of these hoes, all they do is talk, talk
Molly got her up but the perc got me sleepy
Grippin' on the pole and she grippin' on my pee-pee
Bitches on my phone, they all actin' like they know me
I can't ride with lames 'cause they always actin' phony
But I'm still gettin' bands
Papercuts on my hands
Bad bitch from France
Papercuts on my hands

[Chorus]
Choppa go stupid like a retard
Swipe 'em all down like a key card
Why you flex so much in a cheap car?
Racin' out the lot in a Beamer
Rollin' with a stick, all extended clips
Jackets, hollow tips, she gon' lick the tip
Porsche all black
Hit it from the back

[Verse 2]
Pink drop in the mixture
I don't think I'm ever gonna miss her
Blue hundreds in my hands, I'm gettin' richer
Now everybody wanna take a picture, yeah
Take a picture, bitch I'm turnt up
Speedin' through the Hills in a Benz truck
Missin' flights all the time, don't give a fuck
But you gon' still see me countin' chips up
Last year I was broke, I was down so bad
Never would've thought I'd get it this fast
Never gotta stress 'cause God's got my back
I can't lose hope, I ain't goin' out sad

[Chorus]
Choppa go stupid like a retard
Swipe 'em all down like a key card
Why you flex so much in a cheap car?
Racin' out the lot in a Beamer
Rollin' with a stick, all extended clips
Jackets, hollow tips, she gon' lick the tip
Porsche all black
Hit it from the back
