Nosgov, pretender:i
Ill talk to you through satelites
For you ill do thousand miles
It dont get out of my mind
How the love still makes me blind
A plan needed urgent
Lost surgeon, im a play-pretender
Slay me my angel
Im thirsty, i need it
I need it, im thirsty
I need it, im thirsty
I need it, im thirsty
I need it, im thirsty
And i ,i wud do anything 4 u if u ask me
Dont hurt me.........
Upset me...................
Im 2 words apart,i keep them in my mouth
And i, i would do anything for you if you ask me
And i, i would do anything for you if you ask me
And i, i would do anything for you if you ask me
And i, i would do anything for you if you ask me
You been there like a hair stuck in my mouth
Easy to play with my motions no wonder youre still around
I saved everything i got
You still wanna be there why?
I dont know what i did wrong
To deserve that shitty plot
I...i still wonder....why
I will wait...............................
