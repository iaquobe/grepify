Nosgov, World:i
[Verse]
Don't talk to me ever
Since December ain’t lose a feather
Purity in my mind, I've been feeling better
Talk to me never, burn the love letter
I'm in the aether
Fendi on my leather
I’m in the alley
I'm with the ally
Ghosting prolly
Demons on me calling
Vacations in Venice
Wish I could vanish
Looking like Sarah
Singing like lala
I'm smoking raw, raw, raw
Singing like la la la
They talking blah, blah, blah
I do not give a fuck
I'm never sorry
Demons on me, calling
