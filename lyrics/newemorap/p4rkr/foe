[Intro]
D-D-DJ Kurtains

[Verse]
I don't wanna go home
You see me as a friend, I see a foe
I'm not a fag, I'm not a ho
If you don't like me then fuck off cause' it's my show
You ain't expect to see me home
You hatin' on me, put that knife right to your throat
I let it slice, I let it go
Came to the party, got a 'chete in my coat
I'll leave you like 'Murder She Wrote'
Ain't going through shit but some growth
I'm walking down a lonely road
If you deadname me one more time, I'll slit your throat
SLOWSILVER03
SLOWSILVER03, that's the posse
Walkin' with the biggest blades you cannot stop me (Hi Dopa)
Don't matter if you got an army
Can't get in my vicinity then you can't harm me
And that's a message to those people there on Twitter
Baby, I'm more than just a winner
I'm with Wido, I'm with Kurtains, we got spinners
You look at us the wrong way, we'll eat you like dinner
You talk to me, you keep talking
You walked at me, and you keep walking
You calling me, I hear you calling
I think I'm fucking out of lyrics
