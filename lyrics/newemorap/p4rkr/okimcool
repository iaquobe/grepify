p4rkr, ok im cool:i
[Chorus]
I got eyes on the back of my head, I can see shit
I know when to dodge, when you stab me in the back, bitch
I swear that the whole entire world is against me
I told her I just wanna be friends, but she sext me
Just want you to text me, I don't want no extra
You say that you like me, well I think you messed up
I'm a neutral person, I'm afraid to do shit
I just have a bunch of thoughts I don't know what to do with
You say that you love me, but I know you're tired of me
It's okay, I'm tired of me, I know I'm not your ecstasy
I hate when I'm not textin' you, I hate when you're not textin' me
Feel like there's a barricade because I can't say anything
Wish that I could tell you, but I'm used to hiding everything
I know that it's dumb that I got used to hiding everything
I know that it feels like sometimes you don't know the real me
You're a lucky soul, you got the patience just to deal with me
I'm falling
I know sometimes I'm inconsistent, but I just can't help it
I can't explain how bad it's been
The cards that I've been dealt with
I've had cool times, not all the time
There's something that's been killing me
Falling apart, it's tearing me unwillingly

[Bridge]
Wait no, I'm cool
Don't worry about me
I think that I'll be fine as long as I'm just following the rules
I live inside my head
That's not a great thing, but it's keeping me alive
So yeah, I'm cool
Don't worry about me
I think that I'll be fine as long as I'm just following the rules
I live inside my head
That's not a great thing, but it's keeping me alive
So yeah, I'm cool

[Chorus]
I got eyes on the back of my head, I can see shit
I know when to dodge, when you stab me in the back, bitch
I swear that the whole entire world is against me
I told her I just wanna be friends, but she sext me
Just want you to text me, I don't want no extra
You say that you like me, well I think you messed up
I'm a neutral person, I'm afraid to do shit
I just have a bunch of thoughts I don't know what to do with
You say that you love me, but I know you're tired of me
It's okay, I'm tired of me, I know I'm not your ecstasy
I hate when I'm not textin' you, I hate when you're not textin' me
Feel like there's a barricade because I can't say anything
Wish that I could tell you, but I'm used to hiding everything
I know that it's dumb that I got used to hiding everything
I know that it feels like sometimes you don't know the real me
You're a lucky soul, you got the patience just to deal with me
I'm falling
I know sometimes I'm inconsistent, but I just can't help it
I can't explain how bad it's been
The cards that I've been dealt with
I've had cool times, not all the time
There's something that's been killing me
Falling apart, it's tearing me unwillingly
