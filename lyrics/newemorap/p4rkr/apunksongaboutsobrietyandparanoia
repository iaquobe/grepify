p4rkr, a punk song about sobriety and paranoia:i
[Verse 1]
I'm still lyin' on the floor, I'm wishin' I was somethin'
Always fuckin' frontin', crashin' and I'm burnin'
I'm not for your problems, I got shit to handle
Mental is dismantled, but I'm stayin' gentle
Peekin' into target, iPhone in my pocket
I just saw a normie, now I wanna vomit
See you in my dreams now, I am such a weirdo
I'm halfway gay, please stop calling me a queer, ho'
People starin' at me
Look into my eyes and you'll see nothin' but a damn beast
See I'm goin' up, now all my haters wanna Stan me
Creepin' in the night, I treat my bros just like my family

[Bridge]
Creepin' in the night, I treat my bros just like my family
Creepin' in the night, I treat my bros just like my family
Creepin' in the night, I treat my bros just like my family
Creepin' in the night, I treat my bros just like my family
Creepin' in the night, I- la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
I've been sober for a year now
And my system has been cleansed, wow
I can talk now, I can breathe now
I can focus just on me now
Don't need Adderall, don't need Oxys
Don't need Codeine 'cause I got me
I don't like them, they don't like me
They do damage to my body
Just like people, just like words do
And opinions, I'm sensitive
I get hurt too, I will murk you
If you hurt me, I will hurt you
An eye for an eye, and the world was blind
Tears fall from the sky, sayin' goodbye
Jumpin' in the air, smoke around me clears
I can't see shit but a statue

[Outro]
I've been sober for a year now
And my system has been cleansed, wow
I can talk now, I can breathe now
I can focus just on me now
Don't need Adderall, don't need Oxys
Don't need Codeine 'cause I got me
I don't like them, they don't like me
They do damage to my body
