p4rkr, two am:i
[Intro]
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

[Chorus]
Hey, do you see me?
I'm back here by the TV
I'll help you if you want to, I'll be right here if you need me
Wait, what happened? Think life just hit a back end
Of course, it is my fault 'cause when I help this always happens
Hey, do you see me?
I'm back here by the TV
I'll help you if you want to, I'll be right here if you need me
Wait, what happened? Think life just hit a back end
Of course, it is my fault 'cause when I help this always happens
I'm stuck inside, I'm looping
I don't think I can get out
I swear I'm going crazy
I lost my patience, slow down
I think that should've been me
That person there on TV
I'm feeling really empty
Does anybody see me?

[Verse]
In my compartment, I feel like a target
I feel like you hate me, I'm just for the market
And you only like me to say that you know me
So back away slowly, you're so fucking nosey
I feel as I'm ghosted, I'm going unnoticed
Will you even miss me if I'm gone on short notice?
On me, you should focus, stare at me and hold it
I like the attention, I feel like in control, shit

[Chorus]
Hey, do you see me?
I'm back here by the TV
I'll help you if you want to, I'll be right here if you need me
Wait, what happened? Think life just hit a back end
Of course, it is my fault 'cause when I help this always happens
I'm stuck inside, I'm looping
I don't think I can get out
I swear I'm going crazy
I lost my patience, slow down
I think that should've been me
That person there on TV
I'm feeling really empty
Does anybody see me?
