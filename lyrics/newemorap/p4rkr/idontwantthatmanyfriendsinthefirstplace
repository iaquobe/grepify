[Intro]

[Verse]
Bitch you oppin', flodgin', posted on my watch list
Say that you invincible, okay nigga, watch this
One phone call, and his brains we'll get to moppin'
Sorry I'm so hyped up, I'm just dumb obsessed with violence
Anxiety, I'm runnin' out of options
Cut 'em out my life, just like a photo, I just crop 'em
If they start to bother me, I cut 'em off or stop them
Why am I so ignorant? Why am I so toxic?
I don't want that many friends in the first place
Most people I wouldn't depend on the worst day
Circle small because I do not like drama
Got a problem? Then go cry to your momma
Anti-social, anti-fun 'cause I'm a reject
Life's a bitch and I'm a prick, I need to re-check
Do my best every day and I get nothing
Yeah I'm selfish, always in this bitch for somethin'
I still walk around at night lookin' for a fight
Ask me if I wanna fight, I don't know, I might
Rugrats stay still, creepin' really tight
Switchblade off rip, make 'em lose an eye
Will I come? Will I go? I don't know though
Darkroom, bright lights, like it's Hoco
Tryna snatch my shit, huh, that's a no-no
Bitch, fuck you, next up lil' hoe
