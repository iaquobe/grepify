p4rkr, i hate it here:i
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a loser
But it seems that's where I'm heading
And all I wanna do is live my life but my bullshit keeps on spreading
I don't wanna see the future
Cause I don't like where I'm heading
And I know that something is gonna happen
I wait for it everyday
I don't wanna be forgotten
In fact I love the attention
But as always, I can't let that shit go and get right to my head
All I wanna do is stop it
Stop being so damn ignorant
When situations get hard, I just disappear

[Bridge]
And I don't wanna be like that
I wish I couldn't be like that
Why I gotta be like that?
How do I not be like that?

[Verse]
I don't wanna fucking be here
Cause all I do is nothing
Make some music, and lay in bed
And disappoint my friends
I don't feel like I should be here
Cause fuck, I'm never noticed
I'm blowing up, and that's pretty cool
But I still feel I'm fucking lonely
I feel like I'm just a problem
A burden on their chest
A chip on the shoulder, a nail in the tire
The elephant in the room
Ain't been feeling good so often
I don't know what's the problem
Sorry I can't satisfy you anyway

[Refrain]
Look what you made me
I hope that you're happy
I hope that you're staring
I hope that you're laughing
No, I am not happy
Neither am I sad but
I cannot explain it
I cannot explain it
Look what you made me
I hope that you're happy
I hope that you're staring
I hope that you're laughing
No, I am not happy
Neither am I sad but
I cannot explain it
I cannot explain it

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be loser
But it seems that's where I'm heading
And all I wanna do is live my life but my bullshit keeps on spreading
I don't wanna see the future
Cause I don't like where I'm heading
And I know that something is gonna happen
I wait for it everyday
I don't wanna be forgotten
In fact I love the attention
But as always, I can't let that shit go and get right to my head
All I wanna do is stop it
Stop being so damn ignorant
When situations get hard, I just disappear
