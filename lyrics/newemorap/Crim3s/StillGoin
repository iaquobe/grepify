Crim3s, Still Goin:i
Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cause I've been falling, falling, falling
Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cause I've been falling, falling, falling
For what seems like years to me
Well here I am
Give what you can
Shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me
Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cause I've been falling, falling, falling
Do you still have love for me?
Do you still have love for me?
'Cause I've been falling, falling, falling
For what seems like years to me
A face that aches
A heart that breaks
And here I am
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
Speak to me
Speak to me
Speak to me
A face that aches
A heart that breaks
And here I am
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
I shouldn't breathe
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
