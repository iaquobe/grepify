Suicideyear, Spider Feet:i
[Intro: Yung Lean]
(Suicideyear)
Ain't no squad, ain't no boys man, it's Sadboys in this bitch
Lil Lean

[Hook: Yung Lean]
Spiders on my feet but you be caught up in the web
I was never playin', I was rockin' in the bed
I ain't got no baby, Billie Jean, my diamonds red
Chillin' off a benzo when I'm clearin' out my head

Spiders on my feet but you be caught up in the web
I was never playin', I was rockin' in the bed
I ain't got no baby, Billie Jean, my diamonds red
Chillin' off a benzo when I'm clearin' out my head

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
All tainted, Chevy painted heavy, clear the windows out
All silver everything, my mind is hard to figure out
Playoff like the Lakers, money maker, imma get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it, I just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me, hard not to leave my route
Never had to fake it, I just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me, hard not to leave my route

[Verse 2: Yung Lean]
I don't melt for nobody but her
Ridicule my situation, ridicule your words
Livin' with my symptoms like livin' with a bird (bird)
Ten toes down I keep countin' like a nerd
Geeked out but I'm down now, I'm happy, seen the worst
Yeah I love life, but I get lust for another
Yeah I love girls, and I stay around my brothers
Pay myself with Voss, it makes no difference towards others
Show me around and I'll show you all my fears
Take me to a town where they never see my tears
Put in time, but he forgot those years
Sorry I been caught up, but for you I'm always here

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
All tainted, Chevy painted heavy, clear the windows out
All silver everything, my mind is hard to figure out
Playoff like the Lakers, money maker, imma get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it, I just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me, hard not to leave my route
Never had to fake it, I just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me, hard not to leave my route

Playoff like the Lakers, money maker, imma get her out
Page it, get it later, leave you quiet just like a mouse
Never had to fake it, I just break the bread and spread it out
Yeah I keep the bread homie on me, hard not to leave my route

[Outro: Yung Lean]
(Leandoer) Lean, Lean, Lean, Leandoer
(Sadboys) Lean, Lean, Lean, Leandoer
