[Chorus]
Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying

[Verse]
Right on time, you were right on time
Right on time, you were right on time
Right on time, you were right on time
You're stuck in my brain forever
I try figuring out what he did better
I wanna forget you
I'd kill for your love, I'd die for your love, I'd die

[Chorus]
Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying
Sticks and stones in my body
I close my eyes, I want to leave my body
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
Take my blood, raise it high, I see doves from the sky
I feel like I'm dying
Close my eyes, and I'm flying
