Hate on me, no they won't
They only love you when you gone, I was wrong (I can see that now)
This town is evil, yeah, I know (Know)
Ten bags, Disney pills, missin' you when you goin' home
Who you worship when you're all alone? (Alone)
Janitor Lean, I found keys to all the locks (Ayy)
I'm in it to win it, I said fuck what it cost
I sold my soul when I was very young (Yeah, yeah)
I'm so gone (Ayy)

Now I'm outside of a 7-Eleven
Outside and I'm goin' to Heaven
Acid at 7-Eleven (In the rain, in the rain)
