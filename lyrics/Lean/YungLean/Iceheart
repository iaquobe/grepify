Yung Lean, Iceheart:i
[Chorus]
Ice heart, ice on my neck glisten like hearts
Born '96 like G-Star
I hit you quick, fast like darts
(Shooting star)
Prada coat on me, mo Goyard
(Muddy cars)
Fuck what you say, yeah I go hard, ayy
Blowin' on dope in the backyard, ayy
Neon colored stacks in a fast car
Glimmering shadows, yeah, I need dark
Playin' with my life, no guitar (Shootin' star)
N I'm with the crew, we steal hearts (After dark)
I cannot follow, I'm a leader (I'm a leader)

[Bridge]
In my afterlife, I know it's time (It's time, it's time, it's time)
Don't hit my line, don't hit my line
Don't hit my line, don't hit my line
Don't hit my line

[Verse]
Don't hit my line, got a beeper
On top of a mountain with a reaper//
/Tell 'em bring the mask and the cheeta
On top of a cloud inna Beamer (You look dead inside)
Don't get to close, get a seuizure
I cannot follow, I'm a leader

[Pre-Chorus]
(I think I'll see you in my afterlife)
Leandoer, Yung Lean, Yung Lean
Only tonight

[Chorus]
Ice heart, ice on my neck glisten like hearts
Born '96 like G-Star
I hit you quick, fast like darts
(Shooting star)
Prada coat on me, mo Goyard
(Muddy cars)
Fuck what you say, yeah I go hard, ayy
Blowin' on dope in the backyard, ayy
Neon colored stacks in a fast car
Glimmering shadows, yeah, I need dark
Playin' with my life, no guitar (Shootin' star)
N I'm with the crew, we steal hearts (After dark)
I cannot follow, I'm a leader (I'm a leader)
