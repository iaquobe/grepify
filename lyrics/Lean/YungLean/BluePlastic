Yung Lean, Blue Plastic:i
[Verse]
Sew me up, I can be your doll
Stuff me with cotton and take it all
Make me whole, make me walk on Mars
Back in your bedroom, like every fall
Nothing to do here, been gone so long
Nothing to do here, been here so long
Everyone's got ideas, but they're all wrong
Nobody wants to get it, but they're all for talk
Nobody gives a fuck, I'm not the one to talk
Nobody gives a fuck, I'm not the one to talk

[Chorus]
Baby blue plastic, wrap me around
Exploding like fragments onto the ground
Wanna be like magic, burning, not found
I exposed myself, I'm done, I'm down
I'm done, I'm down
Fuck it, I'm done, I'm down

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Baby blue plastic, wrap me around
Exploding like fragments onto the ground
Wanna be like magic, burning, not found
I exposed myself, I'm done, I'm down
Fuck it, I'm done, I'm down
Fuck it, I'm done, I'm down
