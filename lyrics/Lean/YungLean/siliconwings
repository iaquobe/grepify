Yung Lean, silicon wings:i
[Intro]
I see you, see you
See you
(X stacks, x, killer, killer, killer)

[Hook]
Killer instincts, stacks up, silicon wings
Insect skin, red blood on my Timbs
Inject sins, all my boys, they gon' win
Evil magic in my veins, wearing thin
I count two hundred stacks before my day begins
Purple kush and purple hearts, live in a world like Sims
I'm on a pill, I need more bars, got knives on my rims
Crushing K on Visa cards, see you on everything

[Verse]
Psycho instincts, red dove, blood wings
I might fuck up, I'm not in my memory, it's going thin
Into to the mist, into the void, I'm a sith
Darth Maul gadgets in the cloak, don't let them in
I grew up way too fast before my life took turns
I still suffer, burden, and at cross roads, I don't turn
I'm in a sanctuary, Saint Mary, I can't learn
Months of isolation, I forgot that I could hurt
Throw your loud up, clouds up, got my heart with me
Throw your crowns up, ice up, keep it smart with me
She blew a car up, nice drug, keep it dark with Lean
Finna find the light inside, that is dark in me
Meet the crowd, fuck towns up, dogs bark with me
Blow your heart up, Simpson Bart, from the start with me
Think she's proud of ya, she found out why she stuck with me
In the laundromat, red blood from the sharks with me

[Hook]
Killer instincts, stacks up, silicon wings
Insect skin, red blood on my Timbs
Inject sins, all my boys, they gon' win
Evil magic in my veins, wearing thin
I count two hundred stacks before my day begins
Purple kush and purple hearts, live in a world like Sims
I'm on a pill, I need more bars, got knives on my rims
Crushing K on Visa cards, see you on everything

[Outro]
I see you, I see you (See you)
(Killer instincts, silicon wings)
(Stacks up)
