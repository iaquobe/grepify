Unknown Death 2002
Sadboys, emotionalboys
Bitch we live in a UFO
Sky's pink when I'm on ecstasy in Tokyo

[Verse 1]
Molecules expand, molecules exist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Molecules expand, molecules exist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Bi-Bitch you'll cut your wrists, I'ma kill to live
The molecule that's me won't go without a fist
I'm a molecule but I stand in the mist
Bitch you'll cut your wrists, I'ma kill to live

[Hook]
Solar flare, I can see the sky is opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the sky is opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies opening, I'm almost there

[Verse 2]
Posted in that Death Star
Snorting coke with Darth Vader
Posted up, dressed in bapester
All that shit she did, yeah I made her
It’s been awhile since slept alone
I guess I'll see you later
When I catch her in another world I'ma realize why I hate her
Posted up, dressed in bapester
I'ma play her, I'ma rob her, I'ma fuck her with no rubber
I'ma play her, I'ma rob her, I'ma fuck her with no rubber

[Hook]
Solar flare, I can see the sky is opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the sky is opening, I'm almost there
Solar flare, I can see the skies opening, I'm almost there

[Verse 3]
