Yung Lean, Violence:i
[Chorus]
Liquid knives check the prize, live like no tomorrow
I'ma slide, let it ride, gotta change the spot doe
I'ma take what you have if I ever go broke
I'm for ever in the club, you forever broke, bro
New city, different girls, forget where I'm at doe
Suffer, suffer, but I glo
(Yeah, I can't even ride the train no more, man)
Head down in the metro

[Verse]
Sharpen knives to the sky, it's a place of sorrow
On the top of the tower with my bow and arrow
Liquid lies, lost my fright when I saw the rainbow
Lotta ice, lotta ice when we in the castle
Where I go, where I look, they all tend to follow
I see shadows in my dreams, they put me in chokeholds
Want my style , go and steal it, and they called it borrowed
Put the money in motion, I ain't got no morals
Put the money in motion, I pull strings, Giapetto, ayy
Ain't nobody know me, but my name so known
Everybody around me high, but I stay low
(Everybody around me high, but I stay low)
Everybody around me gone, check the condo
Everybody around me evil, they got halos
Hole in my head and my heart so froze
Everybody around me fly, fly like sparrows
Whatever I want, gotta get it pronto
Nine lives like a cat, jumpin' out the window
We make magic, burn cash, you know that's our motto
Whole lotta digits when they scan the barcode, ayy, ayy

[Bridge]
Look into your eyes, I can see your burn slow
I don't wanna know your name, I already seen your soul
Ayy,, not love, love is vein
(See, you're a product of your environment
My environment's a product of me)

[Chorus]
Liquid knives check the prize, live like no tomorrow
I'ma slide, let it ride, gotta change the spot though
I'ma take what you have if I ever go broke
I'm forever in the club, you forever broke, bro
New city, different girls, forget where I'm at though
Suffer, suffer, but I go
Try to hold on but I let go (They clean for you)
Head down in the metro
