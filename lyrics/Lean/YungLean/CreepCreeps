Yung Lean, Creep Creeps:i
[Intro: Yung Lean & Matt OX]
So long
(I'm working on dying)
So long
So long this time
Can’t see you, can't be with you

[Chorus]
Chinchilla, chinchilla, white sneaks
Drug dealers, model friends and creeps-creeps
PTSD, I can't sleep-sleep
Manic when I drink, get out my street-street

[Verse]
Yung Lean, bat boy, hoppin’ out the cave
All my friends does drugs like I'm Nick Cave
In the graveyard with my girl, we used to go to raves
I'm still wilding with the gang, Sad Boys and the Drain
It's a circus in town, SBE parade
I see corpses from the ground, hoppin' on the stage
Chinchilla, leather jackets, swervin' asphalt lanes
I see corpses from the ground, hoppin' on the stage
Bust in, bust down, all eyes on me
Nine lives, Makaveli, I got busted teeth
Twenty deep, V.I.P., that's my cavalry
Yeah, I talk to myself, they think it’s hands-free
Motherfuckers stalk me when I go out to eat
My dreams so big, that’s some shit that I will never reach
I'm a nihilistic shit, I don’t think I could teach
Arms long, octopus, you know I had to reach

[Chorus]
Chinchilla, chinchilla, white sneaks
Drug dealers, model friends and creeps-creeps
PTSD, I can't sleep-sleep
Manic when I drink, get out my street-street
Chinchilla, chinchilla, white sneaks
Drug dealers, model friends and creeps-creeps
PTSD, I can't sleep-sleep
Manic when I drink, get out my street-street

[Outro]
Eyes on, be a man
I can always work for days
She don't know my worth, no way
Eyes low
I can always work for days
I can always work for days
