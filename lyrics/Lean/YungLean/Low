Yung Lean, Low:i
[Verse 1]
This shit feel like Xtacy, into me
I'm only 23 but there's like, like, ten of me
Fendi tee, there's no remedy
I got a lot of enemies
Lose my energy, you can see yourself in me
Hell in me
Never lose myself, I lost, lost many things
Keep working yourself 'fore you do anything
My dreams are in hell, and i won't sell you them
Yeah, I lost a friend but we will meet again

[Chorus]
Oh
Lowlife, lowlife, lowlife
Oh, oh
I'll do anything (Anything, you want)
Oh
Lowlife, lowlife, lowlife
Oh, oh
I'll do anything you want

[Verse 2]
Made a deal, never set you free
Dance with the devil in a flowered dress
Solitude in a cuckoo's nest (Ayy)
Empty villas in the park
 on the way to the hillside
Backseat of your car (Ayy, ayy)
Ey, Ey, We some lowlifes
In the backseat of your car
Cigarette burns on my scars
Wanna get into your house
And she's scratching on her arm
No, I can't work a straight job
But I work hard like my mom
So I break it into half
(And I'll give you what you want)

[Chorus]
Oh
Lowlife, lowlife, lowlife
Oh, oh
I'll do anything (Anything, yeah, yeah)
Oh
Lowlife, lowlife, lowlife
Oh, oh
I'll do anything you want

[Outro]
Running from myself
So I run into the night
Running from myself
So I run into the night
