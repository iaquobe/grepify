Yung Lean, Ghostface / Shyguy:i
[Intro]
Lean
Leandoer (Leandoer in this bitch)

[Verse 1]
I got so much shit up on the stove, it gotta go, I need a boat
Money high, my power low, my heart doin' coke, can't let you go
Don't need this shit, don't need these shows
I'm on a roll, leave earth, need more
So much shit up on the stove
Show up in chrome, I leave in gold
Don't need to sell my fuckin' soul, the devil in me, already know
I do this for my kin, my folks, my bitch, my bros, might buy my soul
You know that I gotta know
Do you love me? Can't let me go
My cousin pourin' Listerine up on the stove, got Louis toes

[Chorus]
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys

[Verse 2]
Burglar bars around the car
Frankenstein boys in my yard
Champagne bloody, fast go-karts
All my boys, they go too hard
Shadow streets, no signs of life
Sounds like Rome, straight from dome
I go hard, yeah, you go home
We not the same, bracelets filled with stone
Sunny, wear it out
Pour up, dirty Sprite (Pour, pour)
You know what Leandoer bitch is all about (All about)
I got bitches and ice, yeah, they think I'm nice
I ain't really friendly, hang with snakes that eatin' mice
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I pour a stripper and get dirty, dirty (Dirty, dirty)
We from the north, yeah we get flirty, flirty
Ayy, we got some demons in this birdie, birdie
Ayy, I fly like an eagle, not no birdie, birdie

[Chorus]
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys
Ghostface, shyguy, dope nice, ride by
Sadboys, drain gang, yeah, they're my guys

[Outro]
