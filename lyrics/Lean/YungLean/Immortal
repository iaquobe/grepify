Yung Lean, Immortal:i
[Hook]
Hold up, 'cause I gotta roll up
Doin' donuts, Euros don't fold up
Four blunts, on the road for four months
I don't like takin' pictures, please ignore us
I'm abnormal, Gargamel, cruisin' in the four door
We rollin' deep, swisher sweets to my portal
Nine cat lives, got nine silver knives
I got big red eyes and I'm feelin' so immortal

[Verse]
Welcome to my corridor
Feelin' like a warlord
Exoskeleton, I became a martyr
Mexico by night if you wanna take a charter
Grind a little harder
Snow white seven dwarves, chains on baller
Ten black bottles with my boys overseas
Cadillacs like melted cheese
Money in my time machine
Went to China, set me free
Silver screens on silver screens
Chandeliers, I may believe
I just do as I please
Sippin' lean as I sleep
Countin' money like it's sheep
Badass bitch on the side of me
She go, 'cause she know
It's all that I need
'Cause she know, 'cause she go
Palmtrees look like seeds
Feelin' so immortal (Lean)
Feelin' like a Warlord
My breeze
My chain, my watch, make you freeze
My breeze
My chain, my watch, make you freeze
