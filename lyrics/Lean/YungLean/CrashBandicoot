Yung Lean, Crash Bandicoot:i
[Intro]
Man, oh man, you should see all the kinds of friends we've got over here at Foster's

[Chorus]
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land
Crash Bandicoot, bands my hands
Trash sandy road, skrrt the land

[Verse 1]
Black antidote, I'm on ten
I'm in the parking lot, where's my man?
I'm off a Xan', off a juice, off a bean
Trapped in our ways, ain't nobody live free
Like Sherlock Holmes, I sneak up on ya easy
I don't like trouble, but it sure likes me
In a French garden on rocks, fell asleep
Moon by my head and the sun at my feet
I tried to paint but I got a disease
You and me together could be something free
Got a lot of money but ain't shit free
Suckers everywhere but bitch I'm sucker free
Serpentine, serpentine, snakes in Columbine
Four cups, two cups, I'm swervin' outta mind
Three girls, two nights, I'm seein' stars tonight
Been in this shit so long, I feel traumatised

[Bridge]
Whip bipolar and my flow schizophrenic
Diagnosed bipolar but I made it through the Atlantic
My whip bipolar and my flow schizophrenic
Diagnosed bipolar but I made it through the Atlantic
Get 'cross the damn Atlantic, you wanna shake my hand bitch
I got all this money, bet that you don't understand it

[Verse 2]
Drop top candlelight, cop drop samurai
I'm sippin' lean mixed with bubbly
Poloâ€™d down Lean, but I don't play no rugby
Don't play no games with me 'cause I play ugly
My team medieval, our helmets are rusty
Helmut Lang, Issey Miyake it must be
Can't take you seriously, nah, you look suspect
I wanna fuck your bones out till you love me
Connection been going down lately, it's nothing
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch, sipping lemonade
Got Coke and whiskey, hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face
Shotgun and a Issey case
Miyake and Yohji on my pants and diamonds in my face
Don't know who to call today
It's summer so I'm chilling straight
On my porch, sipping lemonade
Got Coke and whiskey, hibernate
Snakes in desert in my face
Shotgun and a Issey case
Miyake and Yohji on my pants and diamonds in my face

[Outro]
Leandoer
Foster
Blue music
The new blues
Summer time
