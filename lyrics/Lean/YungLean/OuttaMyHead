Yung Lean, Outta My Head:i
[Verse 1]
I'm off an oxy, I need a clarity
Fu-fuck 'em, I don't care
Twenty for a verse, Yung Lean, I'm everywhere
(Think these nights got the best of me)
She pushed me down the stairs
I'm almost at the edge, I need remedy (So, I don't care)
Big, big deal, signs
Sub-zero ice, leave it all behind (Left all of my sanity)
Did my time
Clear blue skies, smoke, clear blue eyes (All of my vanity)
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Don't wanna be near you or breathe your air (Air)
I'll see you there
You got no loyalty, so I leave you there (Left all of my sanity)
Right where you stand
Never thought that was part of the plan
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head (My head)

[Chorus]
You don't need your friends
You don't need yourself, I don't need no wealth
Wish I had better health
Take care of myself, money stack like two elves
Call my girl when I want
Might stay in there for a month, hotel the room, fuck the cost
I can't
Get you out of my head, Get you out of my head, get you out of my head

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'll give you anything
Baby, are you sure this is what you wanted?
To tell you the truth, I don't trust myself
Talking 'bout the real things
My intention wasn't always honest
I don't wanna talk about your feelings
Can we just live in the moment?
(We can talk about it in the morning)
Baby girl, I know you adore me
Feel my body shivering ('Vering)
To tell you the truth, I'll give you hell

[Chorus]
You don't need your friends
You don't need yourself, I don't need no wealth
Wish I had better health
Take care of myself, money stack like two elves
Call my girl when I want
Might stay in there for a month, fuck the room, fuck the cost
I can't get you out of my head
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Call my girl when I want
Might stay in there for a month, fuck the room, fuck the cost
I can't get you out of my head
Get you out of my head, get you out of my head

[Outro]
Oh, my head
Oh, my head
Get you out of my head (My head)
Oh, my head
Oh, my head
Get you out of my head (My head)
