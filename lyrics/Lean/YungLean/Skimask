Givenchy

[Verse 1]
I got lots of swag and I be feelin' hurt
Walk up in the bank like John Dillinger (Walk up, walk up, walk up, walk up)
Rainbows, I'm willin' to splurge (Splurge)
After you've gone I'm still on the Earth
No, no, no, you can't get my bankroll (Bankroll)
Slow, slow, slow, this cup got me slow (Slow motion)
Low, low, low, shawty bring it to the floor (Get low)
Oh, oh, oh, SBE in this bitch, got more (Sad Boys)

[Chorus]
Ski mask shawty, got whatever you like (You like)
Moncler jackets, dirty cash, plenty flights (Flights, flights)
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about thirty (Thirty)
Ski mask shawty, I pull up with the team (Pull up, pull up)
Ski mask shawty, I still see you in my dreams (Lean)
Dirty Fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (l'll never leave)
Dirty Fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave (Scrr, scrr)

[Verse 2]
Flow, flow, flow on the floor, floor, floor
Percs, Percs, Percs got me out of control (Control)
Iced-out on the floor, rubber bands can't even fold (They can't)
Girls all in my phone, ho-ho, Santa Claus (Ho-ho)
Ski mask shawty, prayin' down to my knees (I'm praying down)
Louis Sprite Gang, shawty all over me
Check out my waist and check out my sleeves (Check it out)
When I ride around I keep my stacks on my feet (When I ride around)
Ski mask shawty keep the racks for the team (For the team)
Ten toes down in my head, I'm not clean (I'm not clean)
Reality for me, I don't see it like you see (I don't)
Broken piano, pockets stuffed with magic beans (Harry Potter)
Walk up in the club, I got like fifty birds (Walk up, walk up)
Need this gun on me, I'm still on the search
I got straight hundreds, straight drop (Straight drop)
Love of my life, she gon' set me up
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up in the parkin' lot (Pull up, pull up)
Bitch, we sellin' wine and breakin' rocks
Just keep going, I don't wanna stop (Don't wanna stop)
Pull up, pull up in the parkin' lot
Dough, dough, dough, I got dough, dough, dough
More like Bart Simpson in my zone, zone, zone (I'm in my zone)
Clone, clone, clone, you a clone, clone, clone (Sad Boys)
All so low, I'ma hop on the road (Hop, hop)

[Chorus]
Ski mask shawty, got whatever you like (Pull up, pull up)
Moncler jackets, dirty cash, plenty flights (There I go)
Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty
I just copped some silver rings and they go about thirty
Ski mask shawty, I pull up with the team (I pull up, pull up)
Ski mask shawty, I still see you in my dreams (Out of control)
Dirty Fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave
Dirty Fanta shawty, bitch, I'll never leave

[Outro]
Santa Claus, Leandoer, Stranger
Shout out Yung Gud, it's just Gud now, man, you already know
Six hundred beats, six hundred days, six hundred songs
I can't sleep no more, gotta make another hit
Wake up in the mornin' and I make another hit
You know how it goin' 'cause life is a bitch
