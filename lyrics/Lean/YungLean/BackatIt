Yung Lean, Back at It:i
[Chorus]
I'm back at it
Yeah, I'm back at it
In a Range Rover
Givenchy backpacking
With two crack addicts
Yeah they back at it
In the club, jetski
Throw it back a bit
I'm back at it
Yeah, I'm back at it
In a Range Rover
Givenchy backpacking
With two crack addicts
Yeah they back at it
In the club, jetski
Throw it back a bit

[Verse]
I'm Darth Vader and this shit get your head up
Need more coke, need more pills, need my bread up
I'm the spider on your skin, you a bedbug
Always talking all this shit but you a big bluff
Trying to get rich in my town, you can text us
Yoshi City, never learn with you, I'm fed up
She go down, so deep down, she get her head stuck
Baby girl, I'm with you, I can switch up
I'm with my bros, hell yeah, they my big ones
I'm the youngest in this shit but I got big bucks

[Chorus]
I'm back at it
Yeah, I'm back at it
In a Range Rover
Givenchy backpacking
With two crack addicts
Yeah they back at it
In the club, jetski
Throw it back a bit
I'm back at it
Yeah, I'm back at it
In a Range Rover
Givenchy backpacking
With two crack addicts
Yeah they back at it
In the club, jetski
Throw it back a bit
