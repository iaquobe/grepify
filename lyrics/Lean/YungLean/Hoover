Yung Lean, Hoover:i
[Chorus]
Lean
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin', homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

[Verse]
Two dead rats, Hennessy, a gallon
Got a lotta shit in my bag like Santa
Bitches see me, hoes gettin' tantrum
Rockstar bitch, I'm like Marilyn Manson
Dirt on my face, bitches think I'm handsome
18, but my money likes expansion
Me and my boys was just out in Aspen
Actin' reckless, people call us madmen
I've always been this way and I call them has-beens
Never gave a fuck 'cause nothing ever mattered
Accept the actions, forget the sanction
Blowin' smoke in your face, became a dragon
Money in my right and my left hand
Ridin' on a horse with a dead man
Xans in my left hand

[Chorus]
Lean
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin' homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris

[Outro]
Fattest bag around town, the law what I don't fuck with
Saddest frown around town, the dogs get to barkin' homie
Bag filled with white lies, sword in the drawer, homie
Leave my body in the night, wake up with some liquor on me
Wake up with some liquor in me
Wake up and the world is empty
Wake up and my bag is empty
Wake up, take a trip to Paris
