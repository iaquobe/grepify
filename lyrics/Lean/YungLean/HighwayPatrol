Yung Lean, Highway Patrol:i
[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
Tryna tell me something, I don't listen
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I see green lights, missed misfits smokin' cannabis
THC bliss, I'm a dove, you're a counterfeit
Draped in silk, but I ain't pay shit for this outfit
Saw you in the lobby once
Robin jeans, my wings were up
Don't fuck with me I'm Hulk Hogan, you saw my face but I'm so numb

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
(Stacks on me)

[Verse 2: Bladee]
Yeah, I got the knife, I don't wanna use it tonight
Let the stars decide if I'm gonna live or die
Gonna lose my mind, runnin', runnin' through the night
Creepin' up outside, with my team, you know I'm high
Pull up with no lights, blowin' smoke, drinkin' ice
What's your blood type, what does it taste like?
Ridin' on my bike when this rain is comin' down
All my boys can fly, we're like angels in the night

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Hundred stacks, hundred stacks on me
Can't leave, can't be free, hunnid stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

[Verse 3: Yung Lean]
Louis, Gucci, Polo, I rock all that shit every day
Catch me in a four-door with Yung Sherman, hop out in LA
Buildings fallin' down, I need money, I need mine today
You can do it how you like, I know I'm stuck up in my ways
I woke up in a Gucci linen bed, I'm feelin' fine today
Make it rain, I make it burn
Take my chances, take my turns

[Outro]
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Runnin' up the highway on a mission, mission
