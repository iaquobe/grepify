Yung Lean, Princess Daisy:i
[Verse 1]
Smoking on some sour in Bahamas
Wearing green Polo pajamas, made of marijuana
Fuck an ugly hoe, like Johnny Drama
Licking off, dripping champagne from my fingernail
Tripping off ginger ale
This tune ain't got no hook
Like a monkey tail
Me and Pedro on this bitch
Wearing aventail
On the beach, with the pink polo
The color of rose, dirty stinking feet
Started drinking whiskey neat
Birdie shrinkin' tree
Yung Lean, it's that curly-haired freak
Take a seat
Got a new passport
Eating lobster in court
Teleport to a new timezone with an escort
Got a fort filled with hoes that just want to snort
Take that boat to my resort
In Hawaii, where I got a tennis court
I forgot to mention that I still get child support

[Verse 2]
Drinking 40s out in Honolulu
With my shawty and she's siftin' on chicken pu-pu
I'm in doo-doo
Hoes sucking nuts but this ain't no Chippendales
Drifting fails, off a drifting tale
Made of minimum wage
Starring in shit movies like Nicolas Cage
I'm drinking a pi√±a colada in the plage
Inhale, exhale, fuck a female
Throw stones on Madlib backstage
