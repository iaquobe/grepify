Yung Lean, Smirnoff Ice:i
[Chorus]
I want the money, I don't care about this
In the night, there's no faces
Smirnoff Ice in the park, your lips (Yeah, yeah)
I walk around in the Matrix
Stockholm Syndrome, they fell in love with the kid
Locked away, keep the safe, yeah
I seen so many souls lost in the wind
I stopped seeing hatred

[Verse]
Drop-top cop car, bitch I fuck a cop car
Lockjaw, locked jaw, wanna be some rockstars
Hotbox, hotbox, you know this is not hard
Summertime, see the sign, walk with you and watch dogs
Pitbulls, big dogs, runnin' through the asphalt
Runnin' 'round the beach and I feel like David Hasselhoff
Nice dreams, nice creams, bitch I got some nice dreams
In the summertime, man, these girls meltin' like ice cream

[Chorus]
(Yeah) I want the money, I don't care about this
In the night, there's no faces
Smirnoff Ice in the park, your lips (Yeah, yeah)
I walk around in the Matrix
Stockholm Syndrome, they fell in love with the kid
Locked away, keep the safe, yeah
I seen so many souls lost in the wind
I stopped seeing hatred
