Yung Lean, Stay Down:i
[Intro]
Way up
Cause I'm way up
I'm up, up, up

[Hook]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my fate
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my fate
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

[Chorus]
I'm bound to stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I'm bound to stay down, stay down, stay down
Girl, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, cause I'm way up

[Verse]
Nitrous oxide, I've seen the world collide
I lost count of all the times she asked me why
Ma-ma-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise
All my, all my, boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life
Fire flames, color red, memories of time
Stacks of shoes, got so many, don't really know the 'mount
When it's hot outside, I copped me some ice
Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes
Mix it with Fanta not with Sprite
, wings from Calvin Klein
Forever I'll fly, all the times that I rewind
Cause I'm way, way high up in the sky

[Interlude]
I got a white shirt and a tangerine belt
I'm in a winter where the snow don't melt
Cause I keep to myself
Cause I keep to myself

[Hook]
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my fate
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait
I'm rollin' blowin away, the days look the same
10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my fate
R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame
Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait

[Chorus]
I'm bound to stay down, stay down, stay down
I guess I'm bound to stay down, stay down, stay down
Girl, I'll be around, around, around
Forever, I'll be around, cause I'm way up
