Yung Lean, Shawty U Know What It Do:i
[Hook]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrists slit when I come through
I'm finna take 'em to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, paint it true
Shawty, you know what it do
Smokin' double, give me two
Shawty, you know what it do

[Verse]
I don't give no fucks 'bout you
I take it all, can never lose
Only myself for my trues
Loving this shit since I was two
Got helicopters on my roof
I'm hiding far away from you
Sad Mob, we don't fuck with fools
Iâ€™m in the snow sipping Grey Goose
Double Gs on my shoe, Gs on my shoes

[Hook]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrists slit when I come through
I'm finna take 'em to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, paint it true
Shawty, you know what it do
