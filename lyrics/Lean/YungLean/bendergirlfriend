Yung Lean, bender++girlfriend:i
[Part 1: bender]

[Verse 1]
Got robotic instincts like I'm Bender
Futurama spaceship, oxy syrup in the blender
Reaching for the stacks, long arms man, Slender
Riding round town, blowing dough, money spender
We all get lost sometimes, but I surrender
Trying to spend the night with you, mark my calendar
Leandoer's still polo'd down like a settler
Freezing moon, started mayhem, nothing's matter

[Chorus]
Gotta check the price
Rubies on my ice
Green gate, cold gate, haunted all my life
Something ain't right
I smell that in the night
Weird phone calls, do you still fantasize
Had to check the price
Rubies on my ice
Green gate, Colgate, haunted all my life
Something ain't right
I smell that in the night
Weird phone calls, do you still fantasize

[Verse 2]
Wintertime
Rain on my blood
Blood, blood, blood rain falling down the sky
I see so clearly now

[Part 2: girlfriend]

[Verse]
I'm scared when you fall, magazines, you're the star
Not far
I'm scared when you fall
My magazines, you're the star
We cannot fall
She fell asleep on my arm
I'm scared when you fall, my magazines, you're the star
We cannot fall
She fell asleep on my arm
On my arm, on my arm, on my arm, on my arm, on my arm
She fell asleep on my arm
On my arm, on my arm, on my arm, on my arm, on my arm
She fell asleep on my arm
I'm scared when you fall, my magazines, you're the star
We cannot fall
She fell asleep on my arm
