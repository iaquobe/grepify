Yung Lean, Blinded:i
[Hook]
All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it

[Verse]
Bitch I'm cruising down the Black Lodge with black wrist watch
Got a bad bitch sipping scotch popping tic-tacs
Pull up with a black car gotta hit the snack bar
Mitsubishi cruising down the lanes like its NASCAR
They say I'm too bizarre, but I done make it this far
Might smoke a fat jetpack out to Mira Mar
I'm feeling like a movie star, counting stacks with my boys in a sushi bar
Uh no you won't get this far, bitch I bet you know who we are
Wake up and I see dark, never let the dogs bark
Leave you looking like a question mark
I be stuntin' overseas, all my boys ride for lean
Bands to the ceiling, smoke away all my feelings
I be, I be getting rich bitch
I just came to sip, left an addict
I guess I admit that I'm an addict
You can't spit, my money standing looking like cabbage
Hashish steady taking trips living lavish

All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded

All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
Bitch I-

All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
All this ice leave you blinded
Five star life, stay reminded
Bitch I done grinded
I pull up with designer, if you with it lean behind it
Bitch I-
