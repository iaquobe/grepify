[Verse]
I don't care about money, so, yeah, I spend it quick
I'm a real-life mannequin, get it then I dip
In a Percocet river, I got gills like a fish
Look like they wanna kill me, but they can only wish
I hop out the whip, make it rain, yeah, the fit
All this ice make you drip, she got blood on her lip
I got tired and shit, so I erase my wish (Leandoer)
Fuck bein' famous, I don't need all that shit
High, high, you high like me?
Why? Why they stare at me? (

Fly, fly, get fly like me (Like me)
Right, right on time, baby (Lean, Leandoer, Lean, Lean, it's Leandoer)
Ravens guard the house, I just keep them within
You presume that you know me, you don't know where I've been
Treehouse of horror, tryna heal from within
Everything is dusty, but to me it's still mint
Can't trust myself, I keep changin' and shit
Keep thinkin' back, but I don't need what I miss
Aquarium life, inside my mind there's a trip (Leandoer)
Much better now, I just don't understand it
I still love you to death, Louis V on my hip
Snakes 'round my house and the clocks don't tick
I still love you to death, Louis V on my hip (Leandoer)
Snakes 'round my house and the clocks don't tick

[Outro]
