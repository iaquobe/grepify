Yung Lean, Opium Dreams:i
[Chorus: Bladee]
In the same place, stuck, stuck
In the same place, stuck, stuck
Off the- off the next day, dread, dread (Dread-ing) the new phase (Dread), head (Dread), space (Dread)

[Verse 1: Bladee]
In a black hole (Stuck), dark (Stuck), dark (Stuck)
Night of the (stuck) soul (stuck), dark, dark
Disarray (Ah, ah), disarray (Ah, ah)
Disarray (Ah, ah), dissociate (Ah, ah)

[Refrain: Yung Lean]
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium dreams (Layin' next to you)
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium (Next to you)

[Verse 2: Bladee]
Black clouds I see
Rain shame on me
Blamed and guilty
Stained and filthy
You, just you

[Chorus: Bladee]
In the same place (You), stuck, stuck
In the same place (Ooh), stuck, stuck
Off the next day (Ooh), dread, dreading
The new phase (Ooh), head space

[Refrain: Yung Lean]
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium dreams (Layin' next to you)
Opium dreams (You're my desire)
Opium (Next to you)
Opium dreams
Opium dreams
Opium dreams
Opium (Layin' next to you)
