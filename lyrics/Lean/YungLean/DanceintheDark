Yung Lean, Dance in the Dark:i
[Intro]
Dance in the dark
Dance in the dark
Dance in the dark

[Chorus]
Dance in the dark (Dance)
You make it so obvious
Made an M off a bar (Dance)
Light a candle in an all white truck
In the back of the bar (Back of the)
We gamble like the mafia
You know I'm a star (Star)
Angel dust in the fairy world

[Bridge]
Tonight she's got that spark
Paralyzed, sleep like Morpheus
Spend two bandz in the park
When u do, it's so oblivious

[Verse]
I'm gone, I'm gone, Yeah u know that I'm gone
Rhinestone, rhinestone, shining like a rhinestone
Lime stone, lime stone, in a cave like lime stone
Off this lean, I move slow like a rhino
I'm gone, I'm gone, yeah, you know that I'm gone
She's a dancer in the dark, we move like tango
Rambo, Rambo, hit the jungle like I'm Rambo
Dancer in the dark, no heart, just sparks (Sparks, sparks)
Oblivious

[Chorus]
Dance in the dark (Dance)
You make it so obvious
Made an M off a bar (Dance)
Light a candle in an all white truck
In the back of the bar (Back of the)
We gamble like the mafia
You know I'm a star (Star)
Angel dust in the fairy world

[Outro]
Oblivious
