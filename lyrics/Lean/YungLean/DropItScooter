Yung Lean, Drop It / Scooter:i
[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Verse 1]
I been droppin' out of helicopters
Hoppin' out of buses
Dropped like twenty on a pinky ring
My stacks sure got them muscles
And my words are like a skeleton
My keychain made in Brussels
I got diamonds on my telephone
You know that Lean done hustled
Neck filled with rose gold
It look like a logo
Hangin' like the old folks
Icy like the north pole
Live my life in slow-mo
Happy when I'm solo
Sun hotter than Togo
My zone is a no-go

[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Verse 2]
Skis on me, it's hot
Drop the fuckin' top
Keychain on my Paris Hilton, dog, I've seen a lot
Why not come with us?
Xannies in the Tuss
I feel like Johnny Depp like from the Blow
Sippin' on a forty, my life is a late night show
I can't understand it when I'm low (Drop it)
Bitches, they come after us
We used to lay on the bus
Hours and hours of dumbin'
Ainâ€™t no more runnin', I'm vicious for lust, Lean
Lost in the woods, you know I cannot speak
My boys blowin' loud, eyes lookin' like peeks
Soldiers of another world, I'm falling into seas
Dark counters, white shadows leanin' over me

[Chorus]
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it

[Outro]
Psycho like I'm Luger, I been flexin' with my new girl
When we walk up in the mall you know we cop it
Drop it on the scooter, eyes like Freddy Krueger
When I come up in the booth you know I drop it
