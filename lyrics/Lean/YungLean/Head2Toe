Yung Lean, Head 2 Toe:i
[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
What you want? Call Bladee, he gon' get it for you, facts
What you need? Want coke? Got a weed-filled bag
Been through hell, seen ghosts, you can't walk my path
I've been to clouds, need a Perc' and double cup my hand
Poppin' pills like Scooby Snacks, seein' colours, Apple Jacks
Please, I can't excuse my being
SBE roll off a bean
Gucci, Louis on my tee
Shawty wanna get with me
They knew we were a problem, they knew not to fuck with Lean

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that

[Verse 2: Bladee]
Twelve skulls bathed in blood (Bathed in blood)
Ten pills, I'm destroyed (I'm destroyed)
I'm up, don't need love
Louis V, black rug
Ice king, I'm back up
Get back, bitch, back up
She said I'm fucked up
I'm Gucci draped up

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that
Head to toe Louis V and Rafs (Lean)
127, yeah, we ball like that
Goin' plus, getting stacks, but I ain't into math (SBE)
I be in a castle making calls like that
