Yung Lean, Pikachu:i
[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, Leandoer

[Chorus]
Dirty towns, thirty ounce, I won't peek at you
Movin' slow, my coke came from Peru
Yellow-black bracelet look like Pikachu (Like Pikachu)
Stone-cold my Stone Island, posted on the roof (Roof)

[Verse]
Ayy, cocaína in her nose, spent a fortune
Shawty bad, shawty shawty, yeah, she gorgeous
Red bottom sky, red bottoms but they orange
She want the Leandoer, these other boys b borin' (Borin')
Velvet Wind she want me in the morning (What you want?)
Keep a chainsaw and a stack in my storage
(Ayy, hang with me, I make a fortune)
(My style ain't got no father like an orphan)
Got your eyes and your smile, but I don't feel like you
See the buildings, they fallin', it's all for her
Pledge allegiance to myself, know what to do
Pledge allegiance to what we started, it's all I do
She stand nude in the hallway
High heels and sip Bomway
So much drama like broadway
Against the world
Fuck what they all say
Made of steel but my heart breaks
I will take care of her (Lean)

[Chorus]
Dirty towns, thirty ounce, I won't peek at you (Won't peek at you)
Movin' slow, my coke came from Peru (Peru)
Yellow-black bracelet look like Pikachu (Like Pikachu)
Stone-cold my Stone Island, posted on the roof (On the roof)

[Outro]
She sing my songs, but she only know the chorus (Sing, sing, sing)
Wanna hang with us, you need a warrant (Warrant)
We can go anywhere, Dora Explorer (Dora, uh)
My boys burnin' trees like the forest
