Yung Lean, Dogboy:i
[Intro]
Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy
End of the world, dogboy
Just, just, just, just, just, just
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy

[Chorus]
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
Chase-what-I-want-boy
Death I can smell
Life is a playground, play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine (Shine, shine, shine)
Life is a playground, play with my grey sounds (Play with my gravestone)
Take me and eat mine, let it shine
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
Chase-what-I-want-boy
Death I can smell (Smell)
Life is a playground, pl-play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine

[Verse]
I'm just a dogboy, play around (Play a—play around)
Life is my play ground, I stay around (Stay around)
Heart made of plastic, let it shine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ghost boy life, think I'm 'bout to loose my mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dogs in my yard and my friends are gone (Gone, gone, gone)
Bullldogs, selling what you want
Tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
I Smile 'cause I have to
You smile 'cause you want
You live 'cause you want to (Ha), But I don't
You breathe 'cause you have to (Ha-ha), I don't care at all
Because Imma a dooog

[Chorus]
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
Chase-what-I-want-boy
Death I can smell
Life is a playground, play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine
Life is a playground, play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
Chase-what-I-want-boy
Death I can smell
Life is a playground, pl-play with my grey sounds
Take me and eat mine, let it shine

[Outro]
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
I'm just a dogboy, dreamboy, ghostboy
Play around, play around, play around, play around
(Gone shine on me)
