Yung Lean, Hunting My Own Skin:i
[Intro]
[?]
Bitch, I'd die for my respect

[Chorus]
We were on the throne
Livin' on our own (Livin' on our own)
Hunting my own skin
Want it to break in (Break it in)
She just wanna dance
I'ma get them bands
Make a lot of stacks
Bitch, I'd die for my respect

[Verse 1]
Wrist diamonds ice (Wrist)
Neon green lights
Don't care about the price (Don't care)
I cop it, I smash it, it's ice (It's ice)
Wrist diamonds ice
Percocet my Sprite (My Sprite)
Perkys in my Sprite (My Sprite)
Louis bag, three stripes
As I walk through the fire with my wings
I could only stop for this iron like a lane
She just want to pop all the molly in the Benz
I've been gettin' rich, makin' money with my friends
Bitch, we off them shits, time to stay until the end
I'm just tryna pop all the bottles, fuck the feds
I got fifty pills all up in Armani bags
She gon' watch how I spend it like just to get it back
Sittin' on the field, snakes through the money tracks
Breakin' in and enterin', bitch, we poppin' tags
Keep the fire burnin' off a blunt like candle wax
Burnin' down your money 'til it ain't nothin' to stack

[Chorus]
We were on the throne
Livin' on our own (Livin' on our own)
Hunting my own skin
Want it to break in (Break it in)
She just wanna dance (She just wanna dance)
I'ma get them bands (I'ma get them bands)
Make a lot of stacks (Make a lot of stacks)
Bitch, I'd die for my respect (Bitch, I'd die for my respect)

[Verse 2]
Flick all my lights (Flick)
Chain, dirty Sprite (Chain, dirty)
Livin' my life, I'm alright
Shawty, she my type (She my type)
Die for this, I might (Lean)
Chains all freeze outside (Leandoer)
Flick all my lights (Flick it on)
Chain, dirty Sprite (Lean)
As I hop by the avenue with my wings
Baby, don't stop, wanna give you everything
When we off them rocks, I'ma tell you everything
Soap on my shoes and on my heart, it's getting thin
But you're a butterfly ridin' through the desert winds
I'm a [?], I love all the finer things
When I come close, close to you I can't sin
Heaven knows I'm bad, but Lord, I can't fix a thing
Fly too close to the sun, my wings give in (Give in)
I gave you my whole life, don't owe you a thing
As I chose life and this rug made of mink
Burnin' down the winter 'cause I'm over everything

[Chorus]
We were on the throne
Livin' on our own (Leandoer, Stranger)
Hunting my own skin
Want it to break in (Break it in)
She just wanna dance (She just wanna dance)
I'ma get them bands (I'ma get them bands)
Make a lot of stacks (Make a lot of stacks)
Bitch, I'd die for my respect (Bitch, I'd die for my respect)
