Yung Lean, Boylife in EU:i
[Verse 1]
Touch me, go on, feel me
Heal me like you would care for me
Touch me, decompose me
Heal me, don't you want to see the real me?
Thrill me, kill the real me
Thrill me, you’re by my side but are you really with me?

[Bridge]
Walk these streets till there's blood on my feet
Walk these streets

[Chorus]
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU (Can't feel my heart, a-argh)
Decompose me, decompose you

[Verse 2]
Pretend that everything is well
That we will meet again
Do you want to meet me again?
Pretend this dream will never end
Some things can’t be unsaid
Awake, awake (Awakening)

[Chorus]
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU
Decompose me, decompose you
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU
Boylife in EU (Can't feel my face, can't feel my heart)
Decompose me, decompose you (Can it stop, being like this)

[Outro]
Boylife in EU
