[Chorus]
She off the pills and I ask, 
"Do you wanna?"
She's just mumblin', blood comin' out her hair
I'm off the drink, off the blow, I'm just gonna
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
She off the pill-pill, the pill, we off the pills and I…
She's just mumblin', blood comin' out her hair
I'm off the drink, drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the…
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere

[Verse]
I'm in Hawaii and you know we in a Rover
Bitches all on us, knock on my door like Jehovah
Promoter said "Ain't nobody came till you showed up"
Leave me five hundred bands exactly when I show up
I'm not feelin' too interested, I'm just modest
I couldn't stop it, I met the girl we was knockin'
We sippin' champagne and the blow, we keep it on us
See us in the club, you know we keep the knives on us
And I be drivin' the fast lane, ain't no way to stop us
I don't want it goin' on, man, but you know we just say "Fuck it"

[Chorus]
She off the pills and I ask, "Do you wanna?"
She's just mumblin', blood comin' out her hair
I'm off the drink, off the blow, I'm just gonna
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
She off the pill-pill, the pill, we off the pills and I…
She's just mumblin', blood comin' out her hair
I'm off the drink, drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the…
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
She off the pill-pill, the pill, we off the pills and I…
She's just mumblin', blood comin' out her hair
I'm off the drink, drink, the drink
I'm off the drink, off the…
We in a bathtub, we good here and everywhere
