Yung Lean, How U Like Me Now? - Bonus Track:i
She pet my fro
I pet her kitty cat
No matter that

And its bare
Just like that swisher back
She empty that

And she pearl like she from
Krusty Krab
We shop the ave
And now we fucking in her fucking bath
Oh yes at last
She mix but she get that ass
From her black past
Oo girl u jingle like you carry cash
Feet on the dash
She want it raw
But I don't want no rash
Oh girl u nasty

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Cancer is my sign
I trying to join Illuminati
Sign my name up on the line
That girl is so my kind
On first appearance don't act kind
Got her number in my phone
She text me on her way home
I like blunts I don't do bongs
Bowls are meant for cereal
I know I said before
But
I'm into them cones
But I'd rather roll by hand
Unless you leaning on a xan
We can fuck but we just friends
I get mad when she say boo
She get mad when I say dude
Well at least she didn't say bro
Cause we not related yo
Don't make me uber home
Because then we just won't speak
Say pardon me
She say I sweep her off her feet
Don't fall asleep
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't waste my time
Like a clock up on a belt
She like it rough
I call her felt
I don't care bout what you felt
Don't care bout how u feel
My whole fam is eating
These tapes be our meals

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
But I'm not really sure he will
Popping bottles and then pop a pill

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my high

I can smoke u down
Let you listen to the soundtrack
Oh my loves and wills
I just need yo ass to chill
And sit yo ass back
So

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my high

Look inside of your heart
Is what you do really approved
Of what you want
Dream is a dream
Until that bitch come true
And
I can fill the pages
Of obstacles in my way
Like lowest of the wages
But I still strive everyday
I hope the struggle ain't contagious
I still make enough to pay, the rent
But the lights?
Maybe don't
Don't fuck with this
It ain't what you want
Cause I'm the dark
You know that we lit
Like candles and cigarettes
I learned to use my wit
To rhyme words and to have fits
I can rap on this track
For like 12 minutes flat
What will I do trainer tell me attack
I'm what these other rapper lack
I'm saying word play and stories
My reference game is on ten
Like yards to first undertaker need a hearse
But first this beat need a verse
I don't lack and don't appeal
To the left wing Mura'terrorist
Who's child even killed
Another child
Maybe open carry isn't that ideal

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
But I'm not really sure he will
Popping bottles and then pop a pill

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my high

I can smoke u down
Let you listen to the soundtrack
Of my loves and wills
I just need yo ass to chill
And sit yo ass back
So
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't waste my high
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't waste my high

Idk
Don't wanna kill this vibe
Lost 2 chains I still shine
Not that employed but I'm alright
Everything I roll be so airtight
Joints be thicker than a Newport
If it ate another Newport
Then I watch some dragon super
This nigga pulled up in two door
We was just like so poor
Now we hot like sulfur
Sulfur in a broiler
Funky like that odor
Get used to me like coasters
Now I want a Tesla or rover
Benz so clean it's kosher
Mike taught me to always be a closer
Then I told me girl come over
We need to be a lil closer
Y'all out the toaster burnt
I'm what they really want
I'm what they really is
This a question or a quiz?
Met this girl her name was Liz
Hooked me up with extra jobs
Now I work like extra hard
Now I get a hundred parts
Now my pockets getting large
Now on the reg I minaj
And that's crazy
I rhyme like not lazy
Gimme this young money Baby
