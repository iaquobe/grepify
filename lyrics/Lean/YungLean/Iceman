Yung Lean, Iceman:i
[Intro]
When I'm in your, uh

[Chorus]
When I'm in your town, see me gone off the ice, man
Jugg with the right hand
Clean wrist, Sprite, man
Look like Tyson
Rich like Mike, man
Bitch on fly, man
Six rings, Iceland
She gone and flippin' the dough
She sprung, she stuck on the floor
Her eyes, they roll over
Stacks all on my floor
She don't want nothing but dro
Back in the whip and it's low
I get the cash and I go
Your love was all on my phone, Lean
When I'm in your town, see me gone off that ice, man
Jugg with the right hand
Clean wrist, Sprite, man
Look like Tyson
Rich like Mike, man
Bitch on fly man
Six rings, Iceland
When I'm in your town, I got bags of the stacks
And frost on the cake, man
Big time sticks
And work with the left hand
Chains on ten fans
Look like ice and you small-time iceman

[Verse]
I go and switch up my flow
Drugs all on the stove
Bags filled with the blow
Leaves fallin' down slow
I pick the frost then I'm froze
No new friends and no new clones
Living on stage, I'm alone
Flippin' and trippin' my walls
Your love was all on my phone
Still posted up by the stove
Stacks and lean my cologne
Dropping and pickin' up dough
Your love was all on my phone
Stacks and lean my cologne
Dropping and pickin' up dough
Still posted up by the stove
Lean

[Chorus]
When I'm in your town, see me gone off the ice, man
Jugg with the right hand
Clean wrist, Sprite, man
Look like Tyson
Rich like Mike, man
Bitch on fly, man
Six rings, Iceland
She gone and flippin' the dough
She sprung, she stuck on the floor
Her eyes, they roll over
Stacks all on my floor
She don't want nothing but dro
Back in the whip and it's low
I get the cash and I go
Your love was all on my phone, Lean
