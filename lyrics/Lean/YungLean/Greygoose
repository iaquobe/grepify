Yung Lean, Greygoose:i
[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck, I just don't do
Pill popping in the club with my whole crew
Billionaire Boys Club, sweater yeah its brand new
Like everything I do its brand new
Now I'm trippin' on that cash flow
Still the same dude with a nice flow
Flex that ass, shawty drop it real low
Shawty goes to pick up dollars all on the flo'
Leandoer with these bitches and hoes
I'm a nice guy and it really goes to prove

[Hook 1]
Now I'm trippin', all I wanna know
Now I'm sippin', Bacardi in the club
Now I'm trippin', like I always do
Up in the club, sippin' Grey Goose
Keep my Polo fitted, now I make news
Turn up in the club sippin' on that Grey Goose

[Verse 2]
Got that vodka and that orange juice
Everything I do is to show I'm brand new
I don't give a fuck what you say
Suck my fuckin' dick and who will run this bitch?
Who will? Lean will, Lean will, Lean will, Lean, Lean, Lean, Lean

[Bridge]
Now I'm trippin' (trippin', trippin') (brand new) (brand, brand new)
Now I'm sippin' (sippin'), like I always do
Now I'm trippin' (trippin'), still the same dude

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got that fashion with Bape shirt
And I'll have ya steam turned up, shawty and panties all free
Now I'm trippin' like I always do
Now I'm sippin', sippin' on Grey Goose
Trippin', I always seem to do
Go up in the club, but nothing's brand new
