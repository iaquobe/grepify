Sold my dreams for some good luck
Palmtrees and they hiding the sun from me

[Chorus]
In Miami, yayo, yayo, yayo, yayo

Fucked my way to the top of the club (Ayy)
Fucked my way to the top of the industry
So I gotta lay low, lay low, lay low, lay low
Lay low, lay low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When you're at the bottom, there's only one way up
I can feel these devils gettin' into me
I've been to the blue velvet, all the way up
I can feel the lies takin' over me
(Takin' over me
Takin' over me)

[Chorus]
In Miami, yayo, yayo, yayo, yayo
Yayo, yayo, yeah (Ayy)
Fucked my way to the top of the club (Ayy)
Fucked my way to the top of the industry
So I gotta lay low, lay low, lay low, lay low
Lay low, lay low, yeah

[Verse 2]
Palm trees, Cadillacs, Ziploc bags
She told me take the trash and come over here
I said if I die here tonite (I die)
I just want you to look over me
At the end of the rainbow, rainbow, rainbow, rainbow
Rainbow, rainbow, yeah
In Miami, yayo, yayo, yayo, yayo
Yayo, yayo, yeah

[Bridge]
Put the city on my back
Now the city is so sad

[Chorus]
I ain't got no halo, halo,
 halo, halo
Halo, halo, yeah
So I gotta lay low, lay low, lay low, lay low
Lay low, lay low, yeah
Fucked my way to the top of the club (Ayy)
Fucked my way to the top of the industry
