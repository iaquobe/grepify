Yung Lean, Fire:i
[Intro]
It ain't even my fault though...
Fire, F-f-f-f-fire
Fire, F-f-f-f-fire

[Hook]
Flames, fire, and a buyer
Leandoer can't expire
We walk in, they stand up like a choir
Bitch I'm smokin' spirit flowers
'Cause you know it takes me higher
My money speeding, no flat tire
Over on this side, it is drier
Louis Vuitton sheets with flowers
Helicopters 'round the windows
Now I'm sipping everything slow
You would think it's the damn intro
I'm ridin' past you in that limo
Sadboy gang, we some heroes
Money pink just like flamingos
Riding past you in that limo
Xans on me, oh Lord
I stick my head out the window

[Verse]
Fuck school, it made me sick
I love my haters, they make me rich
They warned me about this shit
I'ma do this 'til I go extinct
Bitches they know that its Yung Leandoer
Straight from the sewer, posted with Bladee Krueger
Hit 'em and I get 'em, I stack 'em, I rip 'em
Just like my stacks, I got cash in my denim
Salvation, bitch I need my medication (meds)
Sadboy gang, bitch we one nation 
(SBE)
Posted up, celebrating, takin' flights like vacation
Paper tracing, I keep 'em waitin'
Bitch, you know that I keep 'em waitin'

[Outro]
Fire, I'm a seller and a buyer
Leandoer can't expire
We walk in, they stand up like a choir
'Cause you know I got that fire
