Yung Lean, Sandman:i
[Hook]
Sandman CEO
SBE, cash man
Damn man, shawty got it bad with her last man
Fat pants, big diamonds, sipping jasmine
Roll up to the mountain and I'm draped in all black, man
True friends, only roll with true friends
Green tea, straight out the tin can
Think man, reminisce on what has
Has been, hash man
Throw my conscience in the trash can
Trash man, that is what they said I'd be
It's been a good year
It's time to raise the glass man
Cops man, fuck the police, let 'em blast them
Fatten, all my money fattens
What the hell happened?
Fishscale salmon
Hop on the bandwagon

[Verse 1]
All I do is golden
Work more than Saffron
Plasma's, all my TV's plasma's
Patterns, you can see the patterns in my passion
Only roll companions
Wonderland, I'm in Wonderland like I'm Alice
My palace, is going too fast, let me fasten seat belt
Louis V, can you imagine?
MDMA, no Montana
Let me bring this back to land man
Abandoned, leave you abandoned
Fuck with me and you know we leave you abandoned
Let me bring this back to land man
It's been a good year
Bitch, it's time to raise the glass man
